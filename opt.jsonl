A qualitative study using a think aloud approach", "abstract": "Background and importance User interface design features, such as screen layout, density of information, position of messages and use of colour, may affect the usability of electronic prescribing (EP) systems, with usability problems previously associated with medication errors. Aim and objectives To explore users\u2019 perspectives of the on-screen design features of a commercially available EP system and how these are perceived to affect patient safety. Material and methods The study was conducted at a large London teaching hospital during 2018\u20132019. Participants were recruited via adverts on the intranet; all prescribers with experience using the EP system were eligible to participate. We used a mixed qualitative approach. First, prescribers were asked to conduct a prescribing task for a simulated patient using a think aloud approach. Second, we conducted a semi-structured interview with each participant to explore their views in more detail, with a focus on patient safety. Interview questions were developed based on the literature and then piloted. Think aloud and interview transcripts were analysed inductively using a thematic approach. Ethics approval was obtained. Results Ten participants took part (three registrars, three foundation year 1 doctors, two foundation year 2 doctors and two pharmacist prescribers). Key themes from the think aloud and interview transcripts included: (1) EP design features and process flow; (2) benefits of EP systems; and (3) suggestions for improvement. For instance, design features such as screen features and layout were discussed with regards to impact on workflow, as well as \u2018information overload\u2019. Suggestions for improvement were made in relation to embedding trust guidelines and making changes to system design (eg, colour, fonts, customisation) to increase information visibility and enhance overall attention. Lastly, a need was expressed for better support for interacting with patients while using the system, as well as making drug\u2013drug interaction alerts more targeted to support medication safety while also avoiding alert fatigue. Conclusion and relevance We identified specific interface design factors that may improve the usability and/or safety of EP systems, which can be used to inform future experimental research in this area. Limitations include the small sample size; further work should include similar studies on other EP systems.

Approximately 70% of computer users have vision-related problems. For these reasons, properly designed interventions for users with CVS are required. To design an effective screen intervention for preventing or improving CVS, we must understand the effective interfaces of computer-based interventions.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n In this study, we aimed to explore the interface elements of computer-based interventions for CVS to set design guidelines based on the pros and cons of each interface element.\n \n \n METHODS\n We conducted an iterative user study to achieve our research objective. First, we conducted a workshop to evaluate the overall interface elements that were included in previous systems for CVS (n=7). Through the workshop, participants evaluated existing interface elements. Based on the evaluation results, we eliminated the elements that negatively affect intervention outcomes. Second, we designed our prototype system LiquidEye that includes multiple interface options (n=11). Interface options included interface elements that were positively evaluated in the workshop study. Lastly, we deployed LiquidEye in the real world to see how the included elements affected the intervention outcomes. Participants used LiquidEye for 14 days, and during this period, we collected participants\u2019 daily logs (n=680). Additionally, we conducted prestudy and poststudy surveys, and poststudy interviews to explore how each interface element affects participation in the system.\n \n \n RESULTS\n User data logs collected from the 14 days of deployment were analyzed with multiple regression analysis to explore the interface elements affecting user participation in the intervention (LiquidEye). Statistically significant elements were the instruction page of the eye resting strategy (P=.01), goal setting of the resting period (P=.009), compliment feedback after completing resting (P<.001), a mid-size popup window (P=.02), and CVS symptom-like effects (P=.004).\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n Based on the study results, we suggested design implications to consider when designing computer-based interventions for CVS. The sophisticated design of the customization interface can make it possible for users to use the system more interactively, which can result in higher engagement in managing eye conditions. There are important technical challenges that still need to be addressed, but given the fact that this study was able to clarify the various factors related to computer-based interventions, the findings are expected to contribute greatly to the research of various computer-based intervention designs in the future.\n", "year": 2020}

The number of these services is expected to grow in the coming years. This will complicate the user experience due to the complexity required to figure out which of the available services are the most relevant and, also, the need for a user to install a different application (or to browse a specific Web page) for each service of interest. In this article, we introduce a method to determine in real-time the context of a user by leveraging on information gathered from both his personal devices (e.g., his smartphone, tablet and/or smart watch), his social accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). This allows to identify the physical context of the user (position, motion), his logical context (preferences, personal data). We then propose an algorithm which, starting from this contextual information, enables the discovery, the selection of the most appropriate services for a user according to his context. In addition, we have developed a single Android application to dynamically create a graphical user interface for each of the discovered services. This approach improves the user-service interaction providing a common user experience which does not depend on the type of service.", "year": 2016}
{"paperId": "00a526ea0b7e8f7a12ab774ca71274a417f52c5b", "title": "The argument that \u201cthere is nothing new in the competitive intelligence field\u201d", "abstract": "It is often heard, and even more often seen written, for example on social media, that that there is nothing new in the competitive intelligence (CI) field. There are no new ideas, the ideas that are being expressed are the same old, there is no development, there is, at best, stagnation. Even the old claim that CI is dead [1] reappears with a certain frequency [2] : \u201cCompetitive intelligence as a profession is dead. There are fewer and fewer full-time, dedicated CI professionals in organizations, and even fewer legitimate CI departments or functions. The need to understand an organization\u2019s competitors has been diffused to several other functions including market research, finance, sales, R&D and others. What the founders of the profession - Jan Herring, Leonard Fuld, and Ben Gilad - built through the 80s and 90s no longer exists. And organizations are the worse off for it\u201d [3] . Is this true? Yes and No. From a research perspective CI has developed and emerged with information technology (IT) solutions over the past ten years. It has come to the point where it does not make much sense to talk about new CI practices. Most advancements and developments are now about IT solutions and applications. This has again given rise to a whole new world of intelligence related problems and opportunities, not only for engineers but for users of these technologies. It is probably fair to say that the intelligence perspective has never been as important for businesses as it is today. Companies and organizations have never collected and analyzed as much information.\u00a0 Another way to explain this development is to say that CI has evolved, thus is no longer the same. Trying to look for the same or insisting that it has not changed gives the impression that there is nothing new in CI. CI consists of an interesting body of literature, but it was not the first term to deal with questions of intelligence in private organizations, and it is not the last. Before CI there was social intelligence, strategic intelligence and corporate intelligence with their own consultants and literature. As Sawka rightly points out CI was a label used in the 80s and 90s. Other terms used include market intelligence, marketing intelligence, business intelligence,\u00a0collective intelligence, financial intelligence, scientific and technical intelligence, foresight, insight, and equivalent terms in other languages, like \u201cl\u2019information strategique et de la securite economiques\u201d (Sisse) [previously\u00a0\u201cintelligence economique\"], \u201cveille\u201d in French and \u201comvarldsanalys\u201d in Swedish. All these fields, where a field is defined as a body of literature, basically study the same phenomenon, how to gather information to make better decisions. As such intelligence studies is a part of the information age. The information age gave birth to several bodies of literature, of which the more established include information systems, management information systems and customer relations management. The intelligence perspective never really caught on among business scholars, maybe because it was associated with industrial espionage. The intelligence parallel in business is also a bet, the argument that private organizations are better organized as intelligence organizations, much like in state and/or military organizations. The idea is that this will give better information, which again will lead to a competitive advantage. So far, this bet has not caught on. Business organizations continue to be organized much as they were a hundred years ago: into production, sales, marketing, HR, finance and accounting. However, the way people work in all of these departments with ever larger amounts of information and data is starting to look more like intelligence operatives with their extensive system of files. In other words, the CI position never really saw a breakthrough, but CI has become an ever more important part of employees\u2019 jobs, as a function. How can we then explain the frequently raised discussion related to the problems of CI? Let me suggest two answers, one general, the other more specific. Once we create something, we insist that it has either to exist, as it is, or it must disappear, thus at the end it is declared dead. This is the western mind at work, thinking in dichotomies, a thing either exist or it does not exist. There is no room for evolution, only constants. If a phenomenon such as a discipline evolves, we shouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s dead, it just isn\u2019t the same anymore, and nothing is more natural than that. So, what must change is rather the way in which we think about the fields we study. The other suggestion is that the critic of CI has more to do with another problem, the selling of consulting services. The market for consultancy services is highly segmented and fiercely competitive. As consultants we are trying to make a name for ourselves in a niche we can call our own and strive to be an acknowledged expert in it. This takes years, often a whole career. Academic careers are created much according to the same logic so the problem is the same there. The underlying message is \u201cthis is my area\u201d, my niche, and as such I will defend it. What often happens is that another persons\u2019 or group\u2019s area grows into our own and sometimes is better at explaining the reality of our business problem, thus challenging our very raison d'etre. Instead we insist that we are still relevant refusing to read up on other areas. We cease to be curious and the very business problems we study pass on to others. Some would argue this is what happened to CI. So, where is CI today? There certainly are many answers to this question. One suggestion is that it is more often treated as business intelligence again (it very much started there, but then without the IT association), data mining, search engine optimization, social media marketing and digital marketing in general. It suffices to look at the articles in this issue to find other examples: Bleoju et al. write about how MOOCs can be used to teach intelligence. Sperkova writes about customer experience (CX) and voice of customer (VoC). Poblano-Ojinaga et al. write about structural equation modeling for the identification of the intelligence factors. All authors have that in common that the are studying how organizations handle intelligence. In more detail, the first article by Bleoju et al. entitled \u201cEmpirical evidence from a connectivist competitive intelligence massive open online course (CI cMOOC) proof of concept\u201d reveals how \u201cthe CI learning community perceives the capability of a cMOOC to train foreknowledge practices, given the best match between its content and context.\u201d The paper argues for \u201can open intelligence approach to cMOOC collective training.\u201d The second article by Maune entitled \u201cCompetitive intelligence as a game changer for Africa\u2019s competitiveness in the global economy\u201d develops a conceptual framework for how competitive intelligence can be adopted by African countries to improve their performance in the global economy. The third article by Sperkova entitled \u201cIntegration of textual VoC into a CX data model for business intelligence use in B2C\u201d is a summary of her PhD, which will be defended in February 2020 at the University of Economics in Prague, the Department of Information Technologies. The author presents a model to store the customer experience (CX) and voice of customer (VoC) data as part of a business intelligence system. The model can help to improve customer relationships and make future performance more automatic and effective. The fourth article by Palilingan and Batmetan Entitled \u201cHow competitive intelligence can be used to improve a management vocational high school: A case from Indonesia\u201d shows how competitive intelligence can be applied to make a vocational high school more efficient. The fifth and last article by Poblano-Ojinaga et al. entitled \u201cEffect of the competitive intelligence on the innovation capability: an exploratory study in Mexican companies\u201d, is an investigation using a methodology of structural equation modeling for the identification of the intelligence factors, to evaluate their relative importance and relationships with the innovation capability of Mexican companies. The empirical results show that the relationship between competitive intelligence and the innovation capability is indirect, with knowledge management as a mediating factor. Some news worth mentioning: we would like to thank the Swedish Research Council/ NOP-HS for receiving the \u201clarge\u201d grant for Open Access journals for two years starting in 2020. JISIB is now indexed by Crossref, which should give users direct access to PDF full text through databases like Scopus and Web of Science. The SCIP organization, owned by Frost & Sullivan, has been reignited with a new executive director. We wish them good luck. There are numerous conferences on intelligence related topics this spring and next winter. See the JISIB website for details. Some of the editors of JISIB will be at the ICI in Bad Nauheim 11-14 May 2020. We hope to see you there.

{"paperId": "0370185f2b49f4ce72366f3f520b1ed7b98ac1f2", "title": "Cultural Maps", "abstract": "Throughout history, maps have been used as a tool to explore cities. They visualize a city\u2019s urban fabric through its streets, buildings, and points of interest. Besides purely navigation purposes, street names also reflect a city\u2019s culture through its commemorative practices. Therefore, cultural maps that unveil socio-cultural characteristics encoded in street names could potentially raise citizens\u2019 historical awareness. But designing effective cultural maps is challenging, not only due to data scarcity but also due to the lack of effective approaches to engage citizens with data exploration. To address these challenges, we collected a dataset of 5000 streets across the cities of Paris, Vienna, London, and New York, and built their cultural maps grounded on cartographic storytelling techniques. Through data exploration scenarios, we demonstrated how cultural maps engage users and allow them to discover distinct patterns in the ways these cities are gender-biased, celebrate various professions, and embrace foreign cultures. & THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL defines intercultural cities as urban units with diverse population from different nationalities, origins, languages, or religions and beliefs. It crafted strategic actions for reviewing current urban policies of cultural inclusion. This agenda prompts cities to collect data and informal stories on communities, develop participatory methods of citizens\u2019 engagement, and lead public awareness campaigns. Various data collection and visualization techniques can be employed to explore cultural diversity. Among them, maps are widely used to make spatial patterns of cultural production Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MCG.2020.3026596 Date of publication 24 September 2020; date of current version 23 October 2020. Department: Applications Editor: Mike Potel, potel@wildcrest.com 12 0272-1716 ! 2020 IEEE Published by the IEEE Computer Society IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications visible. The earliest examples of cultural maps are archival administrative map series, which document historical place naming processes. Due to the developments in web mapping, maps have become social justice tools promoting indigenous territories (https://native-land.ca), exposing cultural diversity indices, or giving voice to marginalized groups. For example, the Southern Poverty Law Center mapped the public oppression symbols of the Civil War still present in American street names (https://www. splcenter.org/data-projects/whose-heritage), while the feminist association l\u2019Escouade developed an alternative map of Geneva to celebrate female influence through a symbolic renaming of 100 streets (https://100elles.ch). To assess cultural diversity, cities need to first develop mechanisms to quantify their culture; a challenging task due to official administrative data scarcity. Therefore, researchers often resort to unconventional datasets to develop proxies that capture complex socio-cultural characteristics. These include geo-referenced pictures, points of interest, social media photos, and street names, to name a few. Associating a city\u2019s street naming system with socio-cultural dimensions emerged in the 18th century, when street naming practices switched from highlighting cities\u2019 geographic features to establishing commemorative spaces. Street names were used to develop urban indicators of male predominance, women\u2019s societal role, religious connections, and biodiversity. What remains less explored, however, are comparative studies of cities. Examples in this direction are the discovery of commemorative practices of new settlements in Israel, socialistic Poland, and Czechia. But case-based research lacks automated workflows and is mostly done manually by mapping communities or by participants of thematic workshops. For example, the Open Street Maps (OSM) mapping community Geochicas made it possible to investigate the gender distribution of street honorees of 11 Spanish speaking cities including Barcelona, Havana, and Mexico City (https:// geochicasosm.github.io/lascallesdelasmujeres). Overall, previous street names studies have been limited in scale (covering one city or group of cities in the same country), have been restricted to a single cultural dimension, or have lacked appealing visual interfaces to raise awareness about the commemorative practices. While maps have been widely used as tools for cities\u2019 exploration, they have not yet been adopted as visual analytical tools to reason about cities\u2019 culture and create awareness of \u201cwho\u201d stands behind a certain street. To increase citizens\u2019 engagement and awareness, one needs to ensure users\u2019 emotional responses. One way to achieve that, cartographers say, is through visual storytelling, which aims at evoking surprise and inducing reflection. Alternatives include interactive functionalities that incorporate the audience\u2019s voice or show the humans behind the data. Current street names maps use simple thematic mapping techniques to color-code streets based on the honoree\u2019s mother language (http:// str.sg/sgstreets), gender (http://genderatlas.at), (https://equalstreetnames.brussels), or occupation (https://www.zeit.de/feature/streetdirectorystreetnames-origin-germany-infographic-english). Therefore, the main challenge of cultural mapping that remains is how to develop a visual language that represents intangible values encoded in the data such as a city\u2019s global focus or gender bias. To help meet this challenge, our work makes two main contributions: ! a workflow for street names collection in the cities of Paris, Vienna, New York, and London (see section titled \u201cDataset\u201d); ! interactive cultural maps, grounded on cartographic techniques, which promote historic awareness while doing so in a playful way (see section titled \u201cCultural Street Maps\u201d). DATASET From open data sources, we collected and curated a dataset of 4932 streets in four cities, namely Paris, Vienna, New York, and London, which we describe next. For each street, we gathered eight types of information (see Table 1). Paris Using the SPARQL endpoint query service of Wikidata (https://query.wikidata.org), we retrieved a total of 3413 streets located in Paris. Each returned street object, including the field named after, which corresponds to an eponym (e.g., event or person). We used it to filter streets November/December 2020 13 that are named after a person by only taking the eponym instances of the person class. This yielded a dataset of 1808 streets. We then crawled these persons\u2019 Wikipedia pages and obtained each street\u2019s borough, honoree\u2019s name, gender, occupation, date of birth, date of death, and country of origin. After further data cleaning, the final Paris dataset contains information for 1428 honorific streets, and covers the historical period between 1202 and 2011. Vienna The \u201cVienna History Wiki\u201d platform (https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at) aggregates historical knowledge about the city in a structured way (similar to Wikipedia). We crawled the webpages containing the history of a given street, and retrieved an initial dataset of 2481 streets, along with the eight types of information for each street. All German information was translated to English using a Python language translate package. After data cleaning, the final Vienna dataset contains 1662 streets, and covers the historical period between 1778 and 2018. London As no curated London dataset was publicly available, we resorted to Wikipedia entries that referred to London streets. We narrowed down the search space using mentions that typically characterize pages about streets such as \u201cnamed after,\u201d \u201chonor,\u201d and \u201ccelebrate.\u201d This resulted in a dataset of 2500 streets, which were annotated along the eight types of information. Each street was annotated by at least two people through a crowdsourcing task using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform, and we manually resolved conflicts. After data cleaning, the resulting London dataset contains 770 streets and covers the historical period between 1030 and 2013. New York We obtained a curated dataset of 1459 honoric streets from the urban planner Gilbert Tauber (http://nycstreets.info). The dataset is aligned with the eight types of information for each street. After data cleaning, the New York dataset contains 1072 streets, and covers the historical period between 1998 and 2013. Dataset Preparation To ensure consistency across the four datasets, we utilized a unified coding scheme for occupations. Based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations, we mapped each occupation to any of the following 17 occupational groups: legislators, writers, creative and performing artists, science and engineering professionals, health associate professionals, sportsmen, social workers, teaching professionals, businessmen, craft and related trades workers, legal and social professionals, religion representatives, military personnel, royals, politicians, and 9/11 responders and victims. Additionally, we matched each street with its corresponding OSM shape file. To build the cultural maps, we stored the underlying geodata in the PostgreSQL database and designed the interface with Mapbox GL JS library (https://docs. mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api). CULTURAL STREET MAPS Next, we introduce the storytelling techniques used to develop cultural street maps, explain their user interface, and provide map exploration possibilities through a narrative walk-through. Cartographic Techniques for Visual Storytelling Cultural street maps are developed using a map-based visual storytelling conceptual framework and are publicly accessible (http://socialdynamics.net/streetonomics). They are organized into a spatial narrative (plotline) and utilize tropes to introduce the story. Table 1. Dataset structure.

Both factors can cause the decision maker to experience high levels of arousal. Without sound emotional processing, arousal can have detrimental effects on decision making. In this thesis the use of live biofeedback to support emotion perception and thus, to facilitate emotion regulation during emotionally charged decision making is evaluated. \n \nBased on a systematic literature review existing live biofeedback research is analyzed in Chapter 2. A transmission model for live biofeedback is developed that classifies the main components of live biofeedback applications and the flow of information in form of transmission signals. To address the identified research gaps, three experimental studies (study I-III) are designed that investigate the effects of arousal and the use of live biofeedback in electronic markets. \n \nStudy I in Chapter 3 examines how arousal affects purchasing decisions with and without social interaction to analyze the context dependence of the effects of arousal on decision making. The results reveal that in auctions, where social interaction is a key characteristic, arousal increases final prices. Purchasing decisions without social interaction, however, are not affected by arousal. As social interaction has been identified as an essential factor for arousal to affect decision making, the subsequent studies II and III investigate the effects of live biofeedback in markets experiments that involve social interaction. \n \nStudy II in Chapter 4 evaluates the effects of live biofeedback on emotional processing in the context of auction bidding. Without prior biofeedback training this novel user interface element alters decision making processes at a cognitive and affective level. Study participants, who suppress emotional expressions, experience higher levels of physiological arousal. When provided with live biofeedback, this effect is mitigated. Furthermore, participants who receive live biofeedback show increased coherence of physiological and perceived arousal. \n \nStudy III in Chapter 5 examines the use of biofeedback in a game that has frequently been used to model financial markets, that is, the beauty contest game. In this study, participants complete a training in order to familiarize with the live biofeedback prior to the experiment. The analysis reveals that live biofeedback increases arousal perception and reduces suppression of emotional expressions. Importantly, participants who receive live biofeedback yield higher decision making quality. \n \nIn summary, this thesis provides further insights into the effects of arousal on behavior and how live biofeedback affects emotional processing and decision making in electronic markets. The results of this thesis suggest that live biofeedback is a promising tool to support emotion perception, regulation, and decision making of market participants.", "year": 2017}

The definition of optimal placement is context specific; it aims at maximizing measurable aspects of the user experience, and it is derived using expert knowledge embedded in the system, which is based on HCI principles, user studies, and data analytics. We use a novel modeling technique to represent the layout of web user interfaces. The model is unsupervisedly computed on information extracted by several image processing algorithms. The system identifies the website category, builds a layout model, compares it with the relevant optimal model, and recommends an alternative layout of interactive elements. To prove this concept, we present a study on e-commerce websites where placement of the checkout button has a significant impact on the online sale process conversion rate. The system identifies non-optimal placement, and it recommends an alternative position that is likely to improve the conversion rate. The results will be validated based on the Visa Checkout user experience. The system is implemented as an open-source software, and it currently supports the re-positioning of a single interactive element. In the paper, we discuss a further generalization of this approach to support a larger number of interactive objects in a wider spectrum of scenarios.", "year": 2017}

Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, and other -omics generate unprecedented amounts of experimental data about cells or tissues under certain conditions. However, from an epistemological point of view, merely fitting data into a model to explain observations is not sufficient; science should strive to describe simple and logical theoretical systems that are testable and that enable predictions (Popper, 1959). This paper tries to alleviate this dilemma by suggesting data mining strategies to support the conversion of Omics data into resilient models. \n \nInductive science, which draws conclusions from empirical observations, is descriptive, and multiple models can explain the same set of data. The prediction of future events from past observations might be plausible and could appear to be in agreement with our experiences, but the derivation of natural laws or theories cannot be justified by fitting observations into a model. This \u201cproblem of induction\u201d was introduced by Hume in the eighteenth century (Hume, 1748) and is generally accepted in epistemology. \n \nPopper illustrates this fundamental problem in the theory of knowledge creation with his famous example of white and black swans: \u201cNow it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white\u201d (Popper, 1959). \n \nIn contrast, deductive science begins with a hypothesis or theory and proceeds to derive possible conclusions and statements that are testable, either logically or experimentally. Since it might be impossible to verify truth, even assuming infinite data, Karl Popper suggested the concept of falsifiability (Popper, 1959): Instead of collecting evidence in support of a certain hypothesis, the borders of the validity of a hypothesis are systematically explored by testing its possible theoretical consequences. This strategy is known as \u201cThe Scientific Method.\u201d \n \nThe starting point for formulating a scientific hypothesis is usually an idea that gives a fresh and surprising view on reality. Whereas the evaluation of a new theory is a strictly systematic process, the generation of a hypothesis depends on the creativity and intuition of the researcher. \n \nHowever, Omics projects usually start with a biological question or a medical problem (see Figure \u200bFigure1).1). For example, one may wish to investigate the physiological changes of an organism under suboptimal conditions or during a pathological process. Since, in comparative studies, the individuals within a sample group are representatives of a certain treatment or phenotype, stating a null hypothesis (i.e., assuming there is no difference between the groups) is not appropriate. In the context of epistemology, the conclusions drawn from such an exploratory Omics experiment would only have descriptive meaning. However, the obtained data could stimulate the formulation of hypotheses or theories (Weckwerth, 2003), which could then be tested in subsequent experiments for verification or falsification. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nModel development in Omics. Exploratory studies generate data, which can be integrated into descriptive models by statistics methods. Data mining methods allow for the building of predictive models. Furthermore, important variables, as well as hidden ... \n \n \n \nSomeone might protest that life's physiological processes are too complex to be wedged into simple, testable statements. Take the theory of evolution, for instance. Following the principles of the scientific method seems impossible in this case, since the study of dynamic ecosystems would be necessary. However, there is strong evidence that Darwin himself used a hypothesis-driven approach, although giving the public impression that he followed an empirical, inductive methodology in his famous work \u201cOn the Origin of Species by Natural Selection\u201d (Darwin, 1859; Ayala, 2009). He used this trick to ensure that his theory would be more readily accepted by the scientific community, which was evidence-focussed at that time. Darwin's strategy is well documented in a letter written in 1865 to the Scottish botanist John Scott: \u201cLet theory guide your observations, but till your reputation is well established be sparing in publishing theory. It makes persons doubt your observations\u201d (Darwin Correspondence Project, letter: 42061). Popper initially declared the theory of natural selection as \u201ca most successful metaphysical research program.\u201d Later, he accepted the experimental testability of natural selection, thus confirming Darwin's theory to be congruent with the scientific method (Popper, 1978). \n \nClassic statistics methods, such as Student's t-test (Student, 1908), principal components analysis (PCA) (Hotelling, 1933) or hierarchical clustering (HCA) (Ward, 1963) are helpful to extract information from data sets and to prove the significance of differences between sample sets. But, since all values of a measurement series are taken into account for a statistical analysis, speculating on the outcome of future experiments is questionable. \n \nThe data mining approach incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning into statistics, and supports the recognition of patterns within massive data sets. Contrary to traditional statistics, only a partition of the available data is used to train data mining models. The performance of the models during optimization is monitored using an alternate partition of the data, the validation data set. Finally, the error rate of the model is estimated with the remaining data partition (Williams, 2011). Importantly, the testing data were not used when building the model, and thus represent a realistic assessment of the model's correctness when applied to new data sets. \n \nData mining models are only valid in a certain numerical space, but they do provide a semi-automated solution to develop models with predictive power. Further, they deliver an unbiased view on variable importance and thus support the scientist in the creation of hypotheses. \n \nThe first reports on employing data mining tools for Omics data sets appeared about 10 years ago (Truong et al., 2004; Horvatovich et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2006). Nowadays, the implementation of data mining tools in open source software with a graphical user interface, such as Rattle (Williams, 2009) and MetaboAnalyst (Xia et al., 2009), make it fairly easy to employ them in Omics workflows. Further, the predictive models have immediate utility, for example in medical diagnostics or in the classification of organisms. \n \nRecently, we investigated the analysis of proteomics and metabolomics data using current data mining software. Random forest tree models (Williams, 1987) demonstrated excellent performance for the classification of Arabidopsis accessions and tissue types based on un-targeted metabolomics data (Sotelo-Silveira et al., 2015), and groups of chickens with different treatments (Ernest et al., 2012) could be discriminated reliably from targeted metabolomics data. It is noteworthy to point out that this separation was not possible when using clustering methods (Winkler, 2015). Additionally, the variable importance values, which are calculated during model building, point toward metabolites and pathways that are relevant for classification. \n \nFurthermore, we demonstrated the application of association analyses in proteomics. Association analyses unveil relationships between variables and are heavily used in social media and shopping platforms (Williams, 2011). The detection of co-occurring peptides and proteins supports the discovery of protein interactions and alternative biomarkers (Winkler, 2015). \n \nIndependently of the initial experimental design, data mining methods are extremely useful for the disclosure of hidden information and surprising correlations in Omics datasets. The re-evaluation of previously collected data or public databases by data mining methods supports new discoveries and robust predictive models. Universal models, however, must be based on hypotheses that are built from theoretical considerations and that can withstand thorough, continuous testing.", "year": 2016}

The Global Health Cost Consortium (GHCC) designed the Unit Cost Study Repository (UCSR) to be a resource for standardised HIV and TB intervention cost data displayed by key characteristics such as intervention type, country, and target population. To develop the UCSR, the GHCC defined a typology of interventions for each disease; aligned interventions according to the standardised principles, methods, and cost and activity categories from the GHCC Reference Case for Estimating the Costs of Global Health Services and Interventions; completed a systematic literature review; conducted extensive data extraction; performed quality assurance; grappled with complex methodological issues such as the proper approach to the inflation and conversion of costs; developed and implemented a study quality rating system; and designed a web-based user interface that flexibly displays large amounts of data in a user-friendly way. Key lessons learned from the extraction process include the importance of assessing the multiple uses of extracted data; the critical role of standardising definitions (particularly units of measurement); using appropriate classifications of interventions and components of costs; the efficiency derived from programming data checks; and the necessity of extraction quality monitoring by senior analysts.

Due to their effectiveness in reducing users\u2019 information overload (Komiak and Benbasat, 2007) and facilitating users\u2019 decision-making process (Wang and Benbasat, 2008), AGSs have been considered as key influential factors of the success of online shopping websites in facilitating product customization and increasing revenue in ecommerce (Komiak and Benbasat 2006). First-generation AGSs generate advice by asking users to explicitly indicate their product attribute preferences or needs. Such systems are usually labelled as content-filtering recommendation agents (Wang and Benbasat, 2005) and provide users with recommendations that best meet their preferences. Users who rely on such advice-giving systems to make decisions need to have a clear idea about their needs, to spend effort in identifying them, and then expressing or conveying them to the AGS. In recent years, another kind of AGSs, what we will label as second-generation AGSs, have become increasingly popular. Examples of second-generation AGSs include recommendations that appear in the homepages of websites such as Amazon, eBay, and Netflix, and content/ad push in websites like Facebook and Twitter. Unlike first-generation AGSs which directly ask users to provide their inputs of needs, second-generation AGSs implicitly collect and identify users\u2019 information, such as users\u2019 demographic information, past browsing behaviors, purchase behaviors, relationships with other users (Briggs and Smyth, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012), etc., and use these information as the input for their advicegenerating process. In addition, compared to first-generation AGSs, second-generation AGSs employ more complex techniques to analyze data from a diverse set of input sources and generate advice for their users accordingly. Item-based collaborative filtering, an algorithm that generates advice similar to what users have adopted/bought before, and user-based collaborative filtering, an algorithm that offer users advice liked by other users who are similar to them, are basic techniques that support second-generation AGSs (Konstan and Riedl, 2012; Zhou et al., 2012). Based on these techniques, more advanced AGS models have already been suggested (Briggs and Smyth, 2006; O'Donovan and Smyth, 2005; Walter et al., 2008). For example, some researchers proposed a new kind of users-based collaborative filtering models that take into consideration the trust relationship among users (Zhou et al., 2012) to provide users with advice that are liked by other users whom they trust more. Due to the effective decision aids AGSs bring to website users, it is important for website managers to know how to maximize user adoption of their AGSs in order to attract more users and increase website profits. Trust, as a crucial influential factor in IT adoption, has been shown to have an influence on users\u2019 adoption of AGSs (Al-Natour et al., 2008; Komiak and Benbasat, 2006; Wang and Benbasat, 2005; 2008) and product purchase intentions (McKnight et al., 2002; Wang and Benbasat, 2007). UsTrust in Second-generation Advice-giving Systems Workshop on Designing User Assistance in Interactive Intelligent Systems, Portsmouth,UK, 2018 27 ers\u2019 trusts in AGSs can be influenced by a number of antecedents (for a summary, see S\u00f6llner, Benbasat, Gefen et al., 2016; S\u00f6llner and Leimeister, 2013). According to the framework developed by Wang and Benbasat (2008), we summarized the trust antecedents of AGSs, for both firstand secondgeneration ones that have already been studied in the existing literature, into six categories, namely dispositional reasons, institutional reasons, heuristic reasons, calculative reasons, interactive reasons, and knowledge-based reasons. Dispositional reasons include users\u2019 general predispositions to trust other parties. Institutional reasons include societal structures (e.g., legislation, rules, and third-party assurances) that people believe will make an environment trustworthy. Heuristic reasons include users\u2019 impressions of the website/e-vendor and users\u2019 past experiences with the system. Calculative reasons include users\u2019 perceived intelligence/efficiency/personalization of systems, users\u2019 privacy concerns, and users\u2019 perceived possibility/solutions of systems\u2019 mistakes/opportunistic behaviors. Interactive reasons include users\u2019 perceived control over systems, users\u2019 social presence, users\u2019 perceived ease of use, users\u2019 perceived similarity with systems, users\u2019 perceived adaptiveness of systems, users\u2019 decision confidence, etc. Knowledge-based reasons include explanations of how advice is generated/why AGSs ask certain questions. Over the past decade, users\u2019 trusts in first-generation AGSs have been thoroughly studied (Al\u2010Natour, et al., 2006; 2008; Komiak and Benbasat, 2006; Wang and Benbasat, 2005; 2007; etc.). However, our understanding of users\u2019 trusts in second-generation AGSs is in its infancy. Most of the existing research about second-generation AGSs are conducted from a technical perspective, focusing on how to design better algorithms in order to generate higher quality advice. Very few studies, the topics of which are related to users\u2019 perceptions on such systems, only roughly mention the potential trust risks due to the unique features of such systems and stay at the theoretical level. Hardly any empirical studies can be found in the literature. We argue for the necessity of studying users\u2019 trusts in secondgeneration AGSs because users may feel second-generation AGSs are less controllable and less transparent than first-generation ones due to the implicit elicitation of user needs and high complexity of advice-generating algorithms in second-generation AGSs. Accordingly, influential factors of users\u2019 trusts in second-generation AGSs may also be different from those in first-generation ones. Based on the literature, we picked out trust antecedents that were once studied in the context of second-generation AGSs. We found that researchers who studied trust antecedents of second-generation AGSs mainly focused on calculative reasons, interactive reasons, and know-based reasons. The trust antecedents they studied are either unique to second-generation AGSs or more important in the context of second-generation AGSs than that of first-generation AGSs. Accordingly, we proposed design suggestions for trustworthy second-generation AGSs. In order to increase users\u2019 trusts through affecting calculative reasons, we suggest that second-generation AGSs should be designed with intelligence high enough to keep bringing users \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d \u2013 recommendations that they have never thought of but will fall in love with at the first glimpse. We also suggest second-generation AGS designers to provide clear instructions about: a) what kind of user information they collect; b) when, how, and why they collect such information from users; and c) how they will use the collected information; and d) structural assurance that can ensure the privacy and security of users\u2019 input data. In order to increase users\u2019 trusts through affecting calculative reasons, we suggest designers create sufficient opportunities for users to provide feedbacks for previously generated advice to AGSs (e.g. whether users like the advice, why do users like/dislike the advice, etc.). In addition, we suggest designers create interfaces for human intervention when developing second-generation AGSs. In order to increase users\u2019 trusts through affecting knowledge-based reasons, we suggest designers indicate the input used for advice-generating process, use plain words to explain the complex advice-generating techniques, and avoid giving non-specific explanations such as \u201cHere are recommendations for you\u201d. Our research makes contributions in both academic and practical field. Unlike existing research focusing on the design AGS algorithms, we studied trust, a crucial factor of successful adoptions of such AGS technologies. To the best of our knowledge, our research is one of the first to systematically study trust issues on second-generation AGSs in the IS field. As for practical contributions, this paper helps system designers better develop second-generation AGSs by proposing detailed design suggestions.

This study investigates the influence of culture, as well as the specific experience and expectations of Saudi Arabian users, with respect to the design of the user interface of the Arabic version of Facebook. As the Arabic version of Facebook has issues with the engagement of users, this research therefore sought to develop a deeper understanding of the causes of this and to propose viable solutions. This involved a comprehensive examination of the implications of translating user- interface elements from one language to another, looking in particular at the specific cultural needs of Saudi Arabian users, with the intention of improving users\u2019 engagement. This study uses an interpretivist research based on the social construction that was utilised in data collection, consisting of interviews and two sequential questionnaires. The main issues identified in the design of the Facebook user interface were the icons and page layout. The current icon images were shown to be unfamiliar and difficult for Saudi users to understand. This was exacerbated by the labels used, which were also found to be too abstract to be meaningful. Regarding the page layout, the alignments were mixed and inconsistent, the positions of elements were horizontally displayed, the pages were too complicated for effective navigation, and the list of options was too long, adversely affecting comprehension. In addition, there were many language errors in the translated Arabic version. These issues led to confusion and overload among Saudi users, causing stress when navigating through the pages. These factors combined to contribute to a lack of engagement with the Arabic version among Saudi users. The consequences of this experience on users\u2019 behaviour was also investigated. First, some users were found to confine their interaction with Facebook to the home page and to avoid the setting page. Many users expressed a preference for the English version of Facebook over the Arabic version, although some acclimated to the use of the Arabic version, while others migrated to other social media platforms. The findings show that application of the localisation theory demonstrates that user interfaces designed for one culture cannot always be easily modified to suit another culture without significant modification. Therefore, this research has contributed to the knowledge through the development of design guidelines to aid designers in the creation of a more suitable Arabic version of Facebook. Based on the above findings, this design guidelines proposes to guide user interface designers to incorporate elements that take into account cultural issues into the user interface.", "year": 2017}

The emphasis is placed on the necessity to review the companies\u2019 marketing strategies, in particular, due to communication constraints and the corresponding changes in the format of both direct and feedback with the customers. Restrictive measures have changed the format of competition, having created the conditions for its concentration in cyberspace. Changes in the nature of interpersonal communication predetermined by the limited personal activity and the introduction of remote forms of interaction, have generated demand for innovative ways of communication with customers. Other factors that require the adjustment of marketing strategies include the emergence of new behavioral capabilities of consumers associated with the intensive development of digital communication channels. It has been noted that in the digital communication environment, digital platforms provide the main format of communication with the existing customer base and potential customers. In addition, prompt acquisition and processing of data on purchasing behavior of customers allows companies to increase significantly the \u201csensitivity\u201d of marketing research and optimize their own marketing decisions. Among the areas of increasing targeting and personalization of product offerings, the use of elements of artificial intelligence and voice search has been accentuated. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence greatly facilitates and simplifies the work of marketers on the processing and initial analysis of the growing flow of digital marketing data, as well as provides greater efficiency. It has been concluded that widespread use of voice assistants in e-commerce requires companies to rethink radically their approaches to internal data processing, IT investment and customer engagement strategies. Active integration of chatbots into various communication platforms is able to make them universal tools for both business and consumers, which will allow them to become a familiar part of the user experience. Implementation of virtual reality and augmented reality elements in the interface of company websites can significantly diversify the process of collecting information by users and push them to unplanned purchases. It has been indicated that the growing standards of personalization and new rules of customer confidentiality will continue to require companies to be flexible and introduce new technologies in order to adapt permanently their business to new conditions.

Especially, within the fashion industry, e-commerce must be a priority for every brand wishing to remain relevant: according to a recent report, global revenue of the clothes and accessories market is expected to be more than $255 billion USD in 2017. Even more importantly, predictions dictate an annual growth of the market by 12.2%, reaching approximately $355 billion USD in 2020. Although these numbers indeed seem appealing, the experiential nature of fashion items makes it harder to sell products like this online. Most people simply prefer to feel and see how an item looks on them before they actually continue with the purchase. Also, companies must deal with the high-costs generated by people who want to overcome the \u201ctry-before-buy\u201d barrier. Simply a lot of items that are sold online will be returned to the seller. Some companies even report a return rate of up to 50% of their online sales. Which is not helpful considering the following: when a $40 item gets returned, it costs the seller around $15 in shipping and handling. Many profitable e-retailers highlight their focus on customer experience as the reason behind their success. This article highlights that when a website is designed in a customer-centric way, it can lead to organisational changes that will not only increase customer satisfaction but will also ensure a sustainable digital model for the company. However, a customer-focused design calls for information to be collected regarding the users. Unfortunately, many customers are bit reluctant to fill in their personal data online. Clearly, e-commerce websites need to create a sense of credibility and trust for to build a relationship with their visitors. Especially, i they want to turn them into buyers first and into loyal customers afterwards. As mentioned above, e-commerce is a tactic that has the potential to leverage growth for fashion and apparel companies. Of course, only if strategically designed and in the right way implemented. In the following section of this article, a presentation will be given of the (technological) trends tomorrow\u2019s e-commerce pioneers should keep an eye on. Reading the list below helps you to keep ahead of the ever-changing consumer behavior in the digital marketplace. Virtual Fitting Tools To decrease the number of returns, which can really affect an online retailer\u2019s profit margin as demonstrated earlier, one can incorporate in their website a virtual sizing tool to help customers in their choice of the right size and model. Either by allowing customers to compare the product they are interested in online to the fit of a previous purchase through your website or to the measurements of their favourite item (e.g.\u00a0 Virtusize ), or by recommending specific items to visitors based on their fit preferences (e.g.\u00a0 Fits.me ). So, also depending on your products, there are many options out there for you to consider \u2013 while definitely a lot more will be developed that will ensure an even higher ROI. Cutting edge technology, such as augmented reality applications, also is used in specific segments of the market such as accessories, to allow customers to envision how they will look wearing a specific item (e.g.\u00a0 Glasses.com ). Questionnaires On a similar note, to bridge the inconsistencies between a customer\u2019s ideas and reality as regards their style and fit preferences, an increasing number of websites is incorporating short surveys or quizzes that aim to clarify what a customer believes their style is and how they actually prefer to dress. In that way, their buying decisions through the website are closer to their style, leading to fewer items being returned. Personalization A personalized experience on a website -apart from the obvious rapport-building effect with the user- can also allow more efficient customer segmentation for the company. Specifically, by identifying which customers are \u201cserial returners\u201d, the company can avoid offering them the option of free shipping, while discounts and special offers can be used to \u201creward\u201d the customers that do not usually return products. Gamification By making the buying process more fun and interactive, it is possible that visitors will engage more with the website\u2019s content and will eventually end up spending more time browsing, that may translate into spending more money too. A reward can be offered to the users that go through with the game/ application (e.g.\u00a0 Covet Fashion , where visitors dress an avatar with real clothes from the collection and people vote on the best outfits which are then given as prizes) or the company can just use the data collected during the gaming process to offer a more personalized experience to the user in the future (e.g.\u00a0 Sephora , allowing website visitors to upload a picture of themselves and try various shades of lipstick \u2013 which are remembered by the website and then promoted in future visits). Social Validation & Liking Persuading the visitors and potential buyers that the ecommerce environment they are browsing in is safe and credible can be an issue, especially with consumers who are hesitant with online sales. Apart from actually designing prominent Psychology and Marketing specialist suggests that two of the easiest paths to convince even the most skeptical customers, are social validation and liking. More specifically, social approval uses the feelings of \u201cpeer pressure\u201d to influence behavior and is generally used in the form of online reviews by existing customers. The feeling of liking refers to the fact that people are most likely to adhere to a suggested action, when they like the source of the suggestion, as is the case in the employment of physically attractive people in advertisements. An actionable way to take advantage of both the social validation and liking factors, would be to encourage customers to share product reviews with their friends through their various social media accounts: people like what their friends like and are more willing to buy it if it\u2019s approved by people they trust.

The software was chosen on the basis that they are quick prototyping tools to adhere to time constraints. By testing prototypes against a series of customised heuristics, this research can reflect on ways to design MAR interfaces for use in the design industry. Heuristics refers to an existing technique of evaluating application effectiveness following a set criteria. Due to the general nature of heuristics, it is important to define a set that is unique to the project objectives (Nielsen, 1994). By designing and testing the user interfaces with 15 participants from PTW Architects targeting the appropriate demographic, this study outlines strategies of effective mobile augmented reality user interface design, and explores methods of measuring application effectiveness. The experiment uses inspection methods to better understand how to apply heuristic evaluation with appropriate consideration of the iterative design process.", "year": 2017}

Nowadays, during the period of intensive development of the network economy, Internet marketing in business is becoming more and more relevant, in particular Web analytics of business, which should not be based on theoretical indicators, such as the number of applications/calls from the site, but on important for business: the number sales and the amount of income. End-to-end analytics allows you to understand which customers are really beneficial for the business. End-to-end analytics is an analysis of the effectiveness of advertising campaigns based on sales data. With proper configuration, such a system allows you to track the entire sales cycle, starting from the user's first visit to the site and ending with the sale of the order placed by him (possibly even a second one). End-to-end analytics makes it possible to calculate the payback and effectiveness of marketing campaigns, advertising channels, individual ads and even search phrases, which, in turn, allows you to allocate the budget more efficiently, while getting the maximum return on advertising investments. The above outlines the relevance of this research and reflects the purpose of this article as features of the formation of an end-to-end marketing system of Internet analytics. \nResearch methods. The work uses methods of empirical analysis, in particular, methods of comparison, measurement and observation. \nThe results. In this study, the process of optimizing each stage of the sales funnel and\u00a0increasing conversion is considered. E-business conversion is proven to be affected by price, seasonality, competitors, etc., but analytics only affects ad traffic and site interface. The paper divides the tasks of web analytics into two groups: solving a specific problem and end-to-end analytics. The main components of the system of end-to-end marketing Internet analytics are highlighted and it is proved that end-to-end analytics is a system that allows analyzing the effectiveness of advertising based on a large pool of data: sources of advertising, socio-demographic portrait of the user, paths through the site, etc. in connection with CRM- system End-to-end analytics makes it possible to look at the advertising campaign as a whole, determine the effectiveness of individual advertising sources and search phrases and, accordingly, optimize the entire sales force. \nConclusions. It should be noted that the basic components of end-to-end analytics, the list of stages and analyzed data will change for specific theoretical or practical tasks. For the implementation of practical tasks, the composition is directly influenced not only by the type of company and the market in which it operates, but also by its size and the specifics of the existing marketing information technology architecture.

In these handheld devices the available screen space limits the size of the user interfaces elements. This problem is excerbated when a lot of UI elements has to be displayed simultaneously, for example in a on-screen keyboard. Especially users with limitations like decreased vision or motor control can have a hard time using these devices, effectively excluding them from a part of modern social life. In this work we evaluated if hover detection can be used to improve usability for text entry on a smartphone. In several experiments the position of the hovering finger was used to selectively enlarge the UI, to provide visual location feedback on the keyboard or to offer audio assistance. When testing with elderly users, the visual feedback was positively received. Unfortunately the comparatively high latency of the hover detection (about 250 ms) negated any gains in usability. This result was confirmed in tests with young users, who also did not benefit from the hover detection. Most usability gains for elderly users were made by introducing a keyboard layout with larger keys which stayed at that size, regardless of hover position. Visually impaired users liked the idea of a context sensitive magnification as well, but hover detection was not really usable to its inherent lack of haptic feedback. Acoustic feedback did not produce a better user experience for the same reason. Reliable use of hover detection was just not possible without adequate levels of vision. This research showed that assistive technologies on smartphones like selective magnification of the user interface can help users, but only when technical parameters are sufficient for the input process. In this case hover detection allowed us to implement visual, haptic and audio feedback based on the hover position of the finger as a proof of concept. Unfortunately high latency only allowed us to show qualitative improvement, not quantitive. Further improvements in hover detection hardware may make this research relevant again, though.", "year": 2017}

Homosexuality and substance use are criminalized in Malaysia, making GBMSM bear multilevels of social stigma and discrimination, including in health care. Mobile health (mHealth), particularly smartphone apps, is a promising and cost-effective strategy for reaching stigmatized and hard-to-reach populations like GBMSM and linking them to HIV prevention services (eg, HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]), particularly in the context of COVID-19.\n \n \n \n This study aimed to adapt the HealthMindr app (Emory University), which was developed with GBMSM in the United States, to improve HIV testing and PrEP uptake for GBMSM in Malaysia.\n \n \n \n We conducted online focus group discussions (FGDs) between August and September 2021 with 20 GBMSM and 16 community stakeholders (eg, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and nongovernmental organization staff). Participants were asked questions regarding their preferences for functions and features in mHealth apps among GBMSM and suggestions for adapting the HealthMindr app to the Malaysian context. Each session was digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were inductively coded using Dedoose software (University of California, Los Angeles) and analyzed to identify and interpret emerging themes.\n \n \n \n The FGDs with GBMSM revealed preferences for interfacing with apps to access HIV testing, PrEP, and counseling services. Stakeholders showed strong interest in using the app-based platform to deliver integrated care (eg, HIV and mental health). The key themes mostly focused on adaptation and refinement for the Malaysian context and were related to cultural and stylistic preferences (design and user interface), engagement strategies (reward systems, marketing campaigns, and reminders), and recommendations for new functions (enhanced communication options via chat and discussion forums) in a one-stop hub for all HIV prevention needs (HIV self-testing, PrEP, and postexposure prophylaxis) that minimize privacy and confidentiality risks.\n \n \n \n Our data suggest that a tailored HIV-prevention app would be acceptable for GBMSM in Malaysia.

Helping students understand these foundational theoretical concepts can sometimes be difficult, and it is not uncommon for students to \"get lost\" in the details and fail to understand the main concepts. One way to help overcome this problem is to use laboratory classes. Laboratory classes provide students with hands-on learning experiences that help them connect theory and practice. One way students do this is by running experiments, collecting data, analyzing it, and comparing the results to those predicted by theoretical models. This discovery process can help build students\u2019 confidence in existing theories and help them understand these theories at a much deeper level. Although this sounds great, the reality for students in many engineering programs is different. Laboratory equipment is expensive, and even in relatively small laboratory classes (such as one with a dozen students), equipment can be overbooked. Although one or two students may get to run the equipment themselves, the rest may not get those experiences and don\u2019t benefit in the same way as the students who did. This is the exact situation the author faced with a materials science lab course. The bottleneck in this case was the tensile testing machine, and feedback from students about the class included the fact that much of their lab time was spent \"sitting around\" while they waited to be able to use the (one and only) tensile testing machine. To address this problem, we developed a small low-cost tensile testing machine so that students could eventually work concurrently in groups of 2 or 3, each with their own tensile testing machine. The current tensile testing machine prototype has a crosshead with 18in of vertical travel and replaceable load cells of 5kg(11lb) to 500kg (1100lb). This prototype uses a dual leadscrew with a hand crank, an optical encoder to measure distance, a load cell to measure force, and a small 7\" monitor to display the results in real time to the user. An Arduino board is used for data acquisition from the encoder and load cell, and this is connected to a Raspberry Pi computer, which is in turn connected to the monitor. A wireless keyboard with an integrated track pad was used to interface with the machine, whose output is shown on the small 7\" monitor. 1 Pedagogical Context The field of materials science is focused on connecting the concepts of structure, processing, and properties of materials. Materials science textbooks [4] often begin with the topic of structure, then move on to properties and processing. Many students have difficulty seeing the importance of studying structure, even though the structure of materials fundamentally drives the macroscopic properties we observe, and determines the utility and potential applications. One solution to this problem is to begin with an exploration of material testing and properties, then to ask the question, \u201cwhy?\u201d A specific example is, \u201cwhy does steel elongate about 25% before breaking whereas polyethylene stretches to over 500% of its original length?\u201d The effort to lead with properties can only be successful with functional testing hardware. Past efforts to do this have been met with frustration because students spend most of the time waiting for the (one and only) testing machine to become available, or merely watch others conduct tests. Another approach is to forgo physical testing altogether, and to watch videos of testing, or to perform testing simulations [10]. While there may be some benefit in watching others perform tests, it does not have the same impact as personal hands-on experience. Simulations are limited by the pre-programmed material options, and don\u2019t allow exploration beyond these limits. Universal testing machines from leading manufacturers such as Instron and Tinius Olsen cost tens of thousands of dollars each, so purchasing additional machines is not an option for most universities. The primary motivation for this work was to develop a testing platform that would enable more students to engage in hands-on learning of materials science concepts. As a tool for active learning, this builds on decades of literature on active [6,8] and experiential [5] learning. These both draw on the concept of constructivism [3], which in turn relies on discovery learning [1,2], cognitive conflict [7], and learner-centered teaching [9]. Specific educational outcomes for a materials science course that will be served directly by this effort include: 1. Determine mechanical properties from an engineering stress-strain diagram 2. Understand concepts of stress, strain, Hooke\u2019s law, and Poisson\u2019s ratio 3. Understand and calculate true stress and strain 4. Define flexural strength and the influence of porosity for ceramics 5. Understand stress-strain behavior in polymers 6. Define hardness testing techniques and computation methods 7. Understand concepts of property variability and design/safety factors 8. Describe mechanisms of brittle and ductile fracture 9. Define creep and conditions under which it occurs and calculate steady-state creep rate 2 Mechanical System Design and Construction 2.1 Testing Machine Structure The structure for the material testing machine was built exclusively with materials available from a local steel supplier. Plain carbon steel with a material thickness as close as possible to 1/8 in was used, which allowed for high strength and easy weldability. This meant choosing either a 1/8 in (0.125in) or 11 ga (0.120in) thickness. The list of materials used to build the steel structure and cost is shown in Table 1. Prices shown reflect those advertised by online supplier metalsdepot.com. This was done to provide an upper bound on price for anyone interested in building a similar prototype, but all the materials were actually purchased from a local supplier who had them on hand at less than half the cost listed (about $50 USD as opposed to $100 USD). Specific structural dimensions are shown in the CAD drawings given in Appendix A.

Actual parts were sourced from a local steel supplier at a lower cost. The base consists of a 12\u00d716in plate, supported on the two ends by 11/2\u00d7 3/4\u00d712in channel iron. Four lengths of 1 in square tubing are welded in a vertical position on top of the base of the structure, each set of two tubes was placed 1in apart and the crosshead fits between them. The crosshead is made from 1\u00d7 2\u00d7 11in rectangular tubing oriented in the strong direction. The top of the structure is capped by a crossbeam comprised of a 3\u00d7 11in flat bar welded to a piece of channel iron with the open side facing downward. The top crossbeam is secured with four 1/4 in bolts to allow for easy removal of the leadscrews. Under the base plate, another piece of channel iron 141/2 in long is welded to provide additional support and prevent the base plate from bending. This channel iron is welded with the open side facing upward, against the base plate. Further support is provided on the top of the base plate with an additional 1\u00d7 2in section of rectangular tubing welded between the vertical supports in the strong direction. Tools used for this process were an abrasive chop saw for cutting the steel to length, a grinder to remove burs, and a gas metal arc welder for joining the steel.", "year": 2017}

Recent trends in virtual reality (VR) also reflect the importance of interaction with hands. Mainstream virtual reality headsets such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and the Playstation VR all support and encourage the use of their hand tracking controllers. However, tracking hands is very challenging due to their small size and various occlusions. For example, significant portions of the hand can get occluded when people are holding hands together or holding an object. For this reason, makers of VR headsets let their users hold controllers that are more reliably tracked than tracking hands directly. Another problem of hand tracking is that it often adds latency to the system. Furthermore, networked multiplayer interactions are even more challenging to deliver without users noticing delays due to the addition of network delays. In this thesis, we propose ways to overcome the current limitations of hand use in VR by addressing these challenges. To address difficulty of hand tracking, we present a way to estimate the entire hand pose given a few reliably tracked points on the hand. We used a commonly available multi-touch tablet to track the fingertip positions and estimated the entire hand pose from the tracked fingertip positions using a quadratic encoding method. We show that quadratic encoding method yields smooth motions for smooth changes in the fingertip positions and show some demos of manipulation tasks using the interface. We also present a way to handle changing number of fingertip contacts and show that we can identify unknown fingertips. To address the latency in hand tracking and multiplayer interactions, we propose a method to augment hand pose prediction with eye tracking which will be commonly available in the next generation of VR headsets. We will first motivate our approach by presenting our observations of hand-eye coordination. We show that gaze leads grasping actions by an average of 0.726s, leaves the manipulation area as soon as the action is complete, fixates on the tool tips when a tool is held, and sometimes inspects the object without the hand directly interacting with the inspected area. All of the observations will be used to determine how gaze should be used to predict hand pose during different actions. Then, we present a study on predicting grasp types to show that gaze is effective in predicting hand interactions. We found interesting patterns of gaze during bottle grasps before the hand reaches the bottle. We use neural networks to show that these gaze patterns can be learned in order to improve prediction accuracy. Finally, we conclude with application of grasp type prediction in VR and a user study which evaluates the usefulness and quality of hand pose generated based on grasp type prediction. We found similar gaze patterns in VR as in the real-life experiment. The user study shows potential for usefulness of grasp type prediction in VR applications with rooms to improve in the future.", "year": 2021}

Mobile apps could be an effective strategy for improving patient-provider communication and provide resources for self-management to patients themselves. Objective The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a mobile tool for patients with T2D and obesity that utilizes an integrative approach to facilitate patient-centered app development, with patient and physician interfaces. Our implementation strategy focused on the building of a multidisciplinary team to create a user-friendly and evidence-based app, to be used by patients in a home setting or at the point-of-care. Methods We present the iterative design, development, and testing of DiaFit, an app designed to improve the self-management of T2D and obesity, using an adapted Agile approach to software implementation. The production team consisted of experts in mobile health, nutrition sciences, and obesity; software engineers; and clinicians. Additionally, the team included citizen scientists and clinicians who acted as the de facto software clients for DiaFit and therefore interacted with the production team throughout the entire app creation, from design to testing. Results DiaFit (version 1.0) is an open-source, inclusive iOS app that incorporates nutrition data, physical activity data, and medication and glucose values, as well as patient-reported outcomes. DiaFit supports the uploading of data from sensory devices via Bluetooth for physical activity (iOS step counts, FitBit, Apple watch) and glucose monitoring (iHealth glucose meter). The app provides summary statistics and graphics for step counts, dietary information, and glucose values that can be used by patients and their providers to make informed health decisions. The DiaFit iOS app was developed in Swift (version 2.2) with a Web back-end deployed on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant-ready Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform. DiaFit is publicly available on GitHub to the diabetes community at large, under the GNU General Public License agreement. Conclusions Given the proliferation of health-related apps available to health consumers, it is essential to ensure that apps are evidence-based and user-oriented, with specific health conditions in mind. To this end, we have used a software development approach focusing on community and clinical engagement to create DiaFit, an app that assists patients with T2D and obesity to better manage their health through active communication with their providers and proactive self-management of their diseases.", "year": 2016}

One approach for providing health professionals with access to clinical data is to create the infrastructure and interface for a clinical dashboard to make data accessible in a timely and relevant manner. Objective This study aimed to develop and evaluate 2 prototype dashboards for displaying data on the identification and management of lymphedema. Methods The study used a co-design framework to develop 2 prototype dashboards for use by health professionals delivering breast cancer care. The key feature of these dashboards was an approach for visualizing lymphedema patient cohort and individual patient data. This project began with 2 focus group sessions conducted with members of a breast cancer multidisciplinary team (n=33) and a breast cancer consumer (n=1) to establish clinically relevant and appropriate data for presentation and the visualization requirements for a dashboard. A series of fortnightly meetings over 6 months with an Advisory Committee (n=10) occurred to inform and refine the development of a static mock-up dashboard. This mock-up was then presented to representatives of the multidisciplinary team (n=3) to get preliminary feedback about the design and use of such dashboards. Feedback from these presentations was reviewed and used to inform the development of the interactive prototypes. A structured evaluation was conducted on the prototypes, using Think Aloud Protocol and semistructured interviews with representatives of the multidisciplinary team (n=5). Results Lymphedema was selected as a clinically relevant area for the prototype dashboards. A qualitative evaluation is reported for 5 health professionals. These participants were selected from 3 specialties: surgery (n=1), radiation oncology (n=2), and occupational therapy (n=2). Participants were able to complete the majority of tasks on the dashboard. Semistructured interview themes were categorized into engagement or enthusiasm for the dashboard, user experience, and data quality and completeness. Conclusions Findings from this study constitute the first report of a co-design process for creating a lymphedema dashboard for breast cancer health professionals. Health professionals are interested in the use of data visualization tools to make routinely collected clinical data more accessible. To be used effectively, dashboards need to be reliable and sourced from accurate and comprehensive data sets. While the co-design process used to develop the visualization tool proved effective for designing an individual patient dashboard, the complexity and accessibility of the data required for a cohort dashboard remained a challenge.", "year": 2020}

Although there are some existing distributed computing systems, such as Hadoop and Spark, for parallelizing ML algorithms, they only provide synchronous and coarse-grained operators (e.g., Map, Reduce, and Join, etc.), which may hinder developers from implementing more efficient algorithms. This motivated us to design a universal distributed platform termed KunPeng, that combines both distributed systems and parallel optimization algorithms to deal with the complexities that arise from large-scale ML. Specifically, KunPeng not only encapsulates the characteristics of data/model parallelism, load balancing, model sync-up, sparse representation, industrial fault-tolerance, etc., but also provides easy-to-use interface to empower users to focus on the core ML logics. Empirical results on terabytes of real datasets with billions of samples and features demonstrate that, such a design brings compelling performance improvements on ML programs ranging from Follow-the-Regularized-Leader Proximal algorithm to Sparse Logistic Regression and Multiple Additive Regression Trees. Furthermore, KunPeng's encouraging performance is also shown for several real-world applications including the Alibaba's Double 11 Online Shopping Festival and Ant Financial's transaction risk estimation.", "year": 2017}

However, high costs of proprietary headsets and content platforms have inhibited widespread adoption of these technologies in resource-constrained contexts, especially in developing countries (Karre et al., 2019). \nAugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have the potential to transform how we approach education and healthcare, enhancing access and outcomes especially in developing countries. AR/VR furthers United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 4 through inclusive, equitable education and healthcare (United Nations, 2016). VR can simulate immersive learning environments, providing hands-on medical training to healthcare workers in regions with limited resources. By using VR for anatomy and surgery education, healthcare professionals can gain experience without risk to patients. This improves local healthcare capacity and retention of health workers in remote areas. \nSimilarly, AR and VR can enable experiential learning for students without access to labs or materials (Sinou et al., 2023). This facilitates authentic learning for financially or geographically constrained students (van der Meer et al., 2023). AR/VR health interventions can also improve patient diagnosis and care (Sureja et al., 2023). AR glasses for doctors could display patient vitals or past records during examinations to improve diagnostic capabilities. Remote consultations can connect rural healthcare workers with urban specialists via AR assistive tools during complex treatments. AR/VR distraction therapy has also proven effective during painful procedures for children and the elderly (Vaillant-Ciszewicz et al., 2022). Such solutions enhance community health literacy and comfort with medical services, a key challenge in developing contexts. \nThis presentation proposes a practical methodology for opportunities to expand access to AR/VR healthcare and education tools in low-resource settings through three pathways - utilising low-cost VR headsets, employing inclusive user interface design, and using participatory methodologies during content development. \nThe Educational Design Research (EDR) methodology will guide the project through four main phases (McKenney and Reeves, 2020; Karto\u011flu et al., 2020): \n \nAnalysis and Exploration Phase \n \n \nConduct a literature review on AR/VR adoption in healthcare education. \nEngage stakeholders (educators, students, industry partners) through focus groups and interviews. \nAnalyze existing curricula, learning objectives, and assessment practices in healthcare education programs across Australasia. \n \n \nDesign and Development Phase \n \n \nDevelop design principles and guidelines for creating effective AR/VR experiences in healthcare education. \nCollaborate with interdisciplinary teams to design and prototype AR/VR experiences aligned with learning objectives and assessment practices. \nConduct iterative cycles of prototyping, testing, and refinement with stakeholder feedback. \n \n \nImplementation and Evaluation Phase \n \n \nImplement the developed AR/VR experiences in selected healthcare education programs across Australasia. \nEvaluate the effectiveness through mixed methods, including quantitative measures of learning outcomes, engagement, and skill development, as well as qualitative analysis of user experiences. \nConduct formative evaluations for improvement and refinement. \n \n \nReflection and Dissemination Phase \n \n \nAnalyze and synthesize findings from the implementation and evaluation phases. \nRefine the design principles and guidelines based on research findings. \nDevelop a comprehensive framework and guidelines for effective AR/VR implementation in healthcare education across Australasia. \nDisseminate research findings, framework, and guidelines through publications, conferences, workshops, and online resources. \n \nThe project will apply the principles of EDR, such as interdisciplinary collaboration, contextual adaptation, and iterative refinement, to develop a robust and contextualized solution for AR/VR adoption in healthcare education programs across Australasia. \nReferences \nBower, M., Howe, C., McCredie, N., Robinson, A., & Grover, D.

However, traditional educational approaches may not always engage children effectively. To address this, innovative methods are needed to make education more interesting and captivating for children. By incorporating interactive elements such as educational games, multimedia resources, and creative teaching techniques, we can create a learning environment that fosters curiosity, exploration, and active participation. This approach enhances learning outcomes and fosters a lifelong passion for learning in children. In recent years, the advancement of technology has transformed the educational landscape, offering a wide array of resources to enhance learning experiences. Educational games have emerged as a promising tool, particularly in fostering children's interest and engagement in various subject areas. There has been a significant increase in the number of studies, projects, and research efforts dedicated to designing guidelines and frameworks for integrating technology and educational games in the field of education. This increased focus demonstrates the acknowledgment of the significant potential of educational games as effective tools for improving learning outcomes. To ensure the effectiveness of these games, researchers and developers have identified essential features that contribute to their educational value. These features include the ability to stimulate critical thinking, minimize the reliance on textual content, provide user-friendly interfaces, and promote interactivity. By incorporating these elements into game design, educators can create engaging learning experiences that foster deeper understanding and knowledge acquisition among learners. The focus on these crucial features demonstrates the commitment to designing educational games that effectively support learning goals and engage students in meaningful ways. Our project\u2019s primary aim is to design and develop an educational game employing hand movements using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) as an interactive input device. The game aims to enhance children's understanding of arithmetic operations, specifically addition and subtraction, in an enjoyable and captivating manner. The use of LMC enables the recognition of children's gestures representing numbers, thereby providing an interactive learning experience. The objectives of the project include acquiring relevant background knowledge, establishing functional requirements and computational constraints, designing and developing a math game incorporating elements such as 3D animations and pictures, and validating the game's effectiveness in achieving its intended benefits for both children and their teachers.The paper is organized into five sections. Section 1 introduces the problem and outlines the aim and objectives of the project. Section 2 reviews related works in the field. Section 3 presents the system design. Section 4 describes the challenges anticipated during and after implementation. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a summary of our findings, future work, and design considerations.", "year": 2024}

While XR applications are presen tly utilized by a range of retail companies, recent technological developments and societal transformations indicate that these technologies will become a mainstream necessity for success. This paper investigates how XR technologies impact the retail sector, now and in the future. In order to collect substantiated and timely data, this study engages in a multi faceted, qualitative data collection approach including a literature review, attendance at retail conferences and events, and semi-structured interviews with industry experts. Results reveal the implementation of three types of XR technologies are significant contributors to company success: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). They are currently utilized to enhance the customer experience, improve training, conduct consumer behavioral analyses, and develop prototyping for increased efficiency and productivity in product merchandising, packaging and branding. However, i mplementation of these technologies does not guarantee success. This study indicates success of these applications requires an understanding of each technology\u2019s specific affordances in order to effectively integrate them within particular areas of the retail supply chain. Augmented reality is often best suited for consumer applications, while necessary proprietary equipment makes virtual and mixed reality more effective for industrial and enterprise applications. If utilized effectively, these technologies can help increase sales, make the manufacturing workflow more cost effective and efficient, and create a retail landscape that allows for the synchronous success of both brick and mortar stores and ecommerce. Future XR technologies will look to standardize and simplify, and eventually, there will be a collection of uniform XR experiences that will become conventional, easily integrated, and user friendly. If retailers want to be competitive, both in online and offline shopping, this study emphasizes the need to invest in XR technologies and build flexible tech management teams that prioritize XR as a technological resource, and restructure businesses to easily adapt to the rapidly changing tech landscape.", "year": 2020}
{"paperId": "0d14c126649158604dcf29ed7f3083b63240e0ce", "title": "IoTMarketplace : Informing Purchase Decisions with Risk Communication", "abstract": "It is common for people to declare that online privacy is important, to indicate that it is valuable, and to simultaneously behave in a manner inconsistent with these expressed preferences. This discrepancy between users\u2019 concerns and their behavior has been explained by three factors: information asymmetry, bounded rationality, and psychological biases. The conflict between expressions of concern and purchase decisions is amplified as the Internet of Things brings the potential for real-time multimedia surveillance, even at home. But there is not empirical evidence that privacy or security influence purchase decisions about IoT devices. In this work, we design an interface for an Internet of Things (IoT) Marketplace that enables participants to make more privacy aware purchases by addressing three of the factors that are associated with the privacy paradox. We then conduct a between subjects experiment to test the effect of the interaction on product selection. The results from this experiment show that when participants are presented with an interface that addresses all three factors, they purchase IoT devices that are more privacy preserving even if they have to pay a premium to do so. The results also show that when participants are presented only with privacy indicators they do not consistently make privacypreserving device choices if the psychological biases affecting users\u2019 decision making are not also addressed by interaction", "year": 2019}

It is recommended to integrate the obtained categories by the induction method into the marketing activity of the fashion brands. Results. The most important moods of world consumers in the conditions of global world processes were investigated in the work. Four main sentiments have been identifi ed: fear, just resilience, a desynchronized society, and radical optimism. In order to establish the main ways of behavior of players in the market of the fashion industry, the categories of consumers of industrial goods were identifie d: stabilizers, settlers, new optimists. The key areas of new methods of interaction of fashion brands with consumers are the following: - ease of decision-making (sales in stores with a limited range will grow);- quiet trade (rejection of daily uncertainties);- unifi ed commerce (creates uninterrupted interaction with customers on all channels);- referral to archives (resale industry shows signs of acceleration);- hyperlocalized social commerce (possibility of earning a commission for all participants of the offline / online retail chain);- attracting attention to the cities of the second level (shifting attention from oversaturated cities of the 1st level to remote cities of the 2nd level, providing high-speed logistics);- AR / VR purchases (use of virtual reality);- evolution on demand (simplifi cation of US-design (user experience) in the online space\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - capacity (and savings) of packaging (group purchases at reduced prices, minimization of packaging).The obtained data are recommended for implementation in marketing and management activities of Ukrainian fashion brands.", "year": 2021}

In many cases, all of the necessary visual information is not available from a single vantage point, due to factors such as occlusion, level of detail, and limited field of view. In certain instances, strategic viewpoints may need to be visited multiple times (e.g., after each step of an iterative process), which makes being able to transition between viewpoints precisely and with minimum effort advantageous for improved task performance (e.g., faster completion time, fewer errors, less dependence on memory). Many augmented reality (AR) applications are designed to make tasks easier to perform by supplementing a user\u2019s first-person view with virtual instructions. For those tasks that benefit from being seen from more than a single viewpoint, AR users typically have to physically relocalize (i.e., move a see-through display and typically themselves since those displays are often head-worn or hand-held) to those additional viewpoints. However, this physical motion may be costly or difficult, due to increased distances or obstacles in the environment. We have developed a set of interaction techniques that enable fast and accurate task localization in AR. Our first technique, SnapAR, allows users to take snapshots of augmented scenes that can be virtually revisited at later times. The system stores still images of scenes along with camera poses, so that augmentations remain dynamic and interactive. Our prototype implementation features a set of interaction techniques specifically designed to enable quick viewpoint switching. A formal evaluation of the capability to manipulate virtual objects within snapshot mode showed significant savings in time spent and gain in accuracy when compared to physically traveling between viewpoints. For cases when a user has to physically travel to a strategic viewpoint (e.g., to perform maintenance and repair on a large physical piece of equipment), we present ParaFrustum, a geometric construct that represents this set of strategic viewpoints and viewing directions and establishes constraints on a range of acceptable locations for the user\u2019s eyes and a range of acceptable angles in which the user\u2019s head can be oriented. Providing tolerance in the allowable viewing positions and directions avoids burdening the user with the need to assume a tightly constrained 6dof pose when it is not required by the task. We describe two visualization techniques, ParaFrustum-InSitu and ParaFrustum-HUD, that guide a user to assume one of the poses defined by a ParaFrustum. A formal user study corroborated that speed improvements increase with larger tolerances and reveals interesting differences in participant trajectories based on the visualization technique. When the object to be operated on is smaller and can be handheld, instead of being large and stationary, it can be manually rotated instead of the user moving to a strategic viewpoint. Examples of such situations include tasks inwhich one object must be oriented relative to a second prior to assembly and tasks in which objects must be held in specific ways to inspect them. Researchers have investigated guidancemechanisms for some 6dof tasks, using wide\u2013field-of-view (FOV), stereoscopic virtual and augmented reality headworn displays (HWDs). However, there has been relatively little work directed toward smaller FOV lightweight monoscopic HWDs, such as Google Glass, which may remain more comfortable and less intrusive than stereoscopic HWDs in the near future. In our Orientation Assistance work, we have designed and implemented a novel visualization approach and three additional visualizations representing different paradigms for guiding unconstrained manual 3dof rotation, targeting these monoscopic HWDs. This chapter includes our exploration of these paradigms and the results of a user study evaluating the relative performance of the visualizations and showing the advantages of our new approach. In summary, we investigated ways of enabling an AR user to obtain visual information from multiple viewpoints, both physically and virtually. In the virtual case, we showed how one can change viewpoints precisely and with less effort. In the physical case, we explored how we can interactively guide users to obtain strategic viewpoints, either by moving their heads or re-orienting handheld objects. In both cases, we showed that our techniques help users accomplish certain types of tasks more quickly and with fewer errors, compared to when they have to change viewpoints following alternative, previously suggested methods.", "year": 2017}

Gesturebased \ninteraction and VR are two rapidly evolving technologies with a great potential to \ncomplement each other. \nThe gestures used are based on a cognitive model of holding a sphere in your hands \nand tapping on its surface. By using the hand tracker Leap Motion and the Head Mounted \nDisplay Oculus Rift the sphere shaped controller is placed in the user's virtual hands. The \nthesis is a collaboration with Erghis Technologies AB who developed the concept of the \nsphere and software to track the gestures. \nGesture based interfaces are called natural user interfaces.

To meet \nthis design challenge the interface was broken down into the actions the user can perform \nand making sure that they were conveyed to the user and reinforced with feedback.

This study proposes and empirically tests three predictive models of MMOG dependency using a survey of online gaming participants. It finds multimedia realism for social interaction serves as an original antecedent factor affecting other mediating factors to cause MMOG dependency. These mediating factors derive from Uses and Gratifications theory and include: (1) participation in a virtual community, (2) diversion from everyday life, and (3) a pleasant aesthetic experience. Of these, participation in a virtual community has a strong positive relationship with MMOG dependency, and aesthetics has a modest negative relationship. Moderator analyses suggest neither gender nor \u201cfrequency of game playing\u201d are significant but experience playing online games is a significant moderating factor of MMOG dependency.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. Nah, and Siau (2008) conducted an extensive assessment of such opportunities in education. They caution that behavioral, health, and safety issues should not be overlooked. Others (Chen & Park, 2005) have also cited behavioral problems including over-indulgence or psychological dependency on such games (Golub and Lingley, 2008). Such dependency may have negative implications for individuals and for society (Sattar and Ramaswamy, 2004), as when employees feel a compulsion to play MMOGs instead of working. Early research on computer addiction used pathological definitions and behavioral models (Young, 1996). However, recent studies suggest non-pathological dependency behaviors may also develop (Chen, Tarn, & Han, 2004). Aside from behavioral issues in the virtual world, scholars also observe that the realistic imitation of a player\u2019s physical environment may enhance the gaming experience (Garau et al., 2003); others (e.g., Cheng & Cairns, 2005) suggest that this effect may be valid only in certain domains. For example, if a gap exists between the user interface/functionality and players\u2019 skills, players have to learn to master the user interface. Those who do not quickly master these skills could suffer (Dickey, 2005). Thus, while many observers assume that realistic MMOGs lead to a positive user experience, others suggest that realistic MMOGs may lead to psychological changes including dependency. Given the richness of Internet media generally and MMOGs specifically, the theoretical foundations for MMOG dependency must be examined. Such theoretical foundations for MMOG dependency will help both those who are concerned about video game addiction and the video game industry to understand the underpinnings of dependency formation. The relationship between a realistic representation of one\u2019s physical environment and one\u2019s psychological experience with such artificial virtual environment offers some insights as to the extent to which user interface realism has an effect on use experience and user dependency. The present study investigates antecedent factors affecting such dependency. The motivation of the present study is to explore the linkages between (1) software design characteristics (Multimedia Realism for Social Interaction -MRSI), (2) psychological factors that are enhanced by those design characteristics, such as participation in a virtual community, and (3) users\u2019 psychological dependency upon online games. While others write about each of these topics separately, few authors write about their linkages (see Olson & Olson, 2003; Carroll, 1997 for historical reviews of this literature). The present paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature by exploring these linkages. Figure 1 shows possible linkages. For example, software design characteristics such as MRSI may influence a user\u2019s aesthetic experience, sense of diversion, and sense of participation in a \u2018virtual community\u2019 with other users; these psychological experiences, may, in turn, affect MMOG dependency either directly or indirectly. We will briefly review the literature and offer testable hypotheses regarding these possible linkages derived from \u2018Uses & Gratifications\u2019 theory. Then, we will proceed to test these hypotheses. PRIOR RESEARCH AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Addiction and Dependency Excessive Internet use such as playing games has been associated with psychological or behavioral problems, including poor college adjustment (Lanthier and Windham, 2004), depression (Ybarra, Alexander, & Mitchell, 2005; Golub and Lingley, 2008), and interpersonal and financial problems (Yang & Tung, 2007). The detrimental effects to one\u2019s life, work, or relationships intensify if extensive Internet use becomes addictive. Internet addiction is defined \u201cas a psychological dependence on the Internet, regardless of the type of activity once logged on\u2019\u2019 (Kandell, 1998, p. 12). Such a concept has been operationalized and investigated by Young (1996, 1997, 1998b).

It is impractical to implement undergraduate projects or laboratories directly on \u201cbig science\u201d experiments by virtue of their uniqueness, rarity, and running costs. By implementing simulations we can take advantage of the benefits of scalability and reduced running costs [2] in addition to the unique affordances of simulations such as zero acquisition time, enhanced opportunity for iteration of technique, and learning outcomes adaptability [3], all while maintaining a realistic learning experience. There is a danger with virtual laboratories that students \u201cact before thinking\u201d as opposed to \u201cthinking before acting\u201d, with potentially negative effects on their learning and the realism of the experience [4]. In order to minimise this effect and to ensure as realistic an experience as possible, we propose embedding the interaction with simulations within a facsimile of a research group environment which includes time budgeting and peer accountability. We demonstrate the practicality of this concept by implementing a LabVIEW-based simulation of the KATRIN TILO (Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment Test of Inner Loop) tritium gas assaying system [5] which can be adapted for physics, chemistry, and engineering projects. Multiple simulations run at different physical scales and variable timescales, taking advantage of LabVIEW's inherent parallelism, including the quantum mechanics of Raman scattering, isotope exchange mechanics, transmission efficiency of the light collection system, and a realistic interface for controlling the laser, gas handling, and spectral acquisition. 1 Corresponding author: LewisR54@cardiff.ac.uk 1 SIMULATIONS IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS 1.1 Simulations in Research Environments In experimental physical sciences and engineering, simulations are routinely constructed by practising professionals at scales / levels of depth from fundamental physical interactions, through individual experimental components, to comprehensive simulations of entire experimental set-ups. It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a comprehensive review of such simulations; the following examples from physics serve only to illustrate the depth, sophistication, and universality of simulations in the physical sciences. At the fundamental level of physical processes, one encounters highly contextand application-specific single-use simulations in fields as diverse as the particle physics of hadronic showers [6], simulation of muon backgrounds for detector commissioning [7], and gravitational waveform simulations for black hole binary merger searches [8]. Multiphysics suites do exist, however, and are also widely used. Notable examples include COMSOL [9] and ANSYS [10]. At the application level of entire detectors or elements of detectors, one encounters more frequent use of general-purpose multiphysics and simulation tool-kits such as GEANT package, applied for example to calibrate calorimeters [11] or muon flux through the KATRIN main detector [12]. Such simulations and iterative comparison with experiment are a vital part of the design and evaluation process for devices of all scales, from portable neutron flux detectors [13], to large satellites [14], to entire \u201cbig science\u201d experimental set-ups and facilities [15], [16]. This practice is nothing new in engineering and industry, however; aerospace have long used simulationand hardware-in-the-loop [17], [18], and it remains a central pillar of modern engineering practice [19]. In summary, simulations in research and industrial environments are vital and ubiquitous. Their implementation is usually thoroughly planned, often highly complex, cover every conceivable time, energy, and length scale and are iteratively linked to experiment / implementation by design. As a consequence of their application, such simulations are restricted to use by the host research group / institution / company, and are very rarely adapted for wider use. 1.2 Simulations in Educational Environments When considering the use of simulations in higher education in physical sciences and engineering, the concept of the \u201cvirtual laboratory\u201d is commonly encountered [1], [2]. This term hints at the inextricability of a simulation from its educational context. In the field of physics education, for instance, the importance of learning concepts by means of constructing models is emphasised [20]. Formal modelling frameworks have been developed which emphasise the students\u2019 engagement as practising researchers and the iterative nature of model construction [21], construction of models in a mixed-reality setting [22], and the effect of the blurred boundaries between physical and virtual laboratories [23]. Indeed, the dividing line between what a practising scientist might consider a simulation and a virtual environment is itself blurred. The blurring is further complicated by the module/ programme-level framework into which the laboratories are embedded; examples include realistic \u201cpractice-centred\u201d project-based learning frameworks with time budgets, peer-accountability, and the real possibility of failure [3], and more traditional discrete \u201clearning units\u201d closer in form to typical undergraduate laboratories. The latter appears to be the dominant form; educational simulations / virtual laboratories are rarely \u201clarge scale\u201d, in both the sense of operational complexity and breadth of the underlying concepts. Rather, simulated experiments are often virtual versions of simple undergraduate experiments [24]\u2013[29]. This is in stark contrast to the research and industrial simulations already discussed. Within the educational context, simulations / virtual laboratories are instances of active learning, which are well-known to have an overall positive effect on student learning [30]. Virtual laboratories have a number of potential enhancements over physical laboratories, what Nolen and Koretsky refer to as the \u201caffordances\u201d of the virtual environment. Affordances in turn influence the instructional design of a virtual laboratory, such as the overlaying of visual representations of invisible phenomena on a user interface (UI) [3]. Potkonjak et al. neatly summarise the advantages of virtual laboratories such as lower operational and maintenance costs due to the lack of physical equipment, ease of reconfiguration, and multiple, simultaneous (perhaps remote) access, balanced against disadvantages such as the necessity of (possibly large) computer and software resources, the typical lack of (often instructive) \u201cbad\u201d outcomes in a \u201csafe\u201d virtual environment [2]. Interestingly, Potkonjak et al. state that \u201cthe final stage in training ... requires real equipment\u201d [2]. The use of the word \u201ctraining\u201d suggests a predefined idea of the purpose of virtual laboratories. In the context of physics virtual laboratories this is debatable, since understanding of underlying fundamental concepts is likely the intended learning outcome, rather than mastery of a particular experimental set-up. In summary, the operating context of simulations as part or the entirety of a virtual laboratory is very different to that of research simulations, and are typically restricted (although not always) to small-scale defined-concept implementations, although they are evidently very effective in this role. 2 PROPOSAL: BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL REGIMES We observe that there is a gap in the educational application of simulations in virtual laboratories that lies between the simple, small-scale virtualisation of traditional laboratories, and the simulation / computer operation of large-scale experimental set-ups in research environments. More specifically, there is little opportunity for undergraduate students to experience operation of cutting-edge \u201clarge\u201d experimental set-ups, and hence limited access to realistic experience of grappling with the complexities researchgrade experimental work. We propose the use of simulations of practical experimental set-ups as flexible, robust, and, above all, realistic virtual laboratories. The general principle is either to adapt existing simulation and experimental control software for educational use and / or to develop applications which simulate the operation and physical processes underlying a particular experimental set-up. It is likely that a research group will have several such applications that could be adapted, or existing simulation elements that could be combined within a framework such as a LabVIEW project or a GUI-driven Python application. An advantage of this approach is that institutions will already have the authors / maintainers of the source software and a team of experts in the field on-site. We note, however, that development time may be significant, so it is likely that a virtual laboratory lead would actually develop the application in consultation with the research group. Specific implementations will naturally vary between disciplines and in light of the intended learning outcomes of the planned activities. In this paper we suggest one possible specific implementation in order to illustrate the general principle; the development of a simulation of a subsystem (TILO) of a large experiment (KATRIN), based in large part on repurposing existing code. We suggest, without prescription, the use of the LabVIEW development environment due the relative ease of UI development and inherent parallelism. We further suggest how this proof-of-principle implementation can be adapted for multiple disciplines (physics, chemistry, engineering), and adapted and scaled for use in a remotelyand multiply-accessed virtual environment. 2.1 General Simulation Requirements A simulation of an educational experimental set-up will ", "year": 2019}

Therefore, a mobile gesture interaction method is proposed to unify operation and feedback regions to provide users with more immersive interaction experiences. Specifically, the proposed method (PG) integrates a leap motion (LM) device with a HoloLens (HL) augmented reality (AR) glasses, which provides a natural mobile interaction interface between real bare hands and virtual objects in a real environment. To obtain an accurate mobile interaction between the real bare hand and virtual objects, the PG provides an effective registration method between LM and HL AR glasses. To ensure the accuracy and stability of the gesture data, the Kalman filter (KF) and the particle filter (PF) are applied to estimate the position and the orientation of the hand. The proposed interaction method provides a gaming interaction method similar to real-world interaction in daily life, which significantly improves the immersive experience of games. Game experiments and user subjective experience analysis are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the PG.

This is illustrated by melting and refining processes such as Vacuum Induction Melting (VIM), ;Jacuum Arc Remelting (VAR), Electro Slag Remelting (ESR), Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Electron &an1 Cold Hearth Remelting (EBCHR). The materials involved are nickel-base superalloys, specialty steels. refractory metals such as tantalum, niobium, tungsten and molybdenum, and the reactive metals hafnium, zirconrum and titanium, together with their alloys. The mastery of these refining processes requires a perfect knowledge of the physical-chemical phenomena involved, including both thermodynamic aspects and transport mechanisms within the liquid metal and at the interfaces (particularly that between the melt and the vacuum or gaseous phase), together with the behaviour of inclusions. Examples are described to show how this knowledge of the basic phenomena can be combined with process modelling to improve the control of product quality. I INTRODUCTION In the field of melting and remeltir~g, the principal techniques concerned are the VIM (Vacuum Induction Melting), VAR (Vacuum Arc Remelting), EBM (Electron Beam Melting), and EBCHR (Electron Beam Cold Hearth Remelting) processes, and a number of others, such as Plasma Cold Hearth Remelting, Cold Crucible Induction Melting, etc. A wide range of metals and alloys are concerned, but because of the high process costs, they are principally limited to high value added products, such as titanium and zirconium and their alloys, niobium, tantalum, the superalloys and numerous high performance nickel or iron base materials. The phenomena involved in these melting and remelting techniques are both numerous and complex.The phenomena which must be considered are : the thermodynamic equilibria, the various transfer mechanisms within the liquids : the movement of the liquid metal, p,articularly with regard to electromagneric stining and turbulence, the movement of the slag, heat transfer processes, transfer of the different solute elements, the displacement of inclusions, Article published online by EDP Sciences and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp4:19937136 JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE IV the transfer mechanisms at the various interfxes : liquid metal/vncuum (or gas), liquid metal/solid. liquid metal/inclusions, liquid metalhefractory, liquid metallslag. It must be remembered that a material is fabricated to fulfil specific functions, which require certain properties, themselves dependant on the composition and the structure of the material. In order to satisfy this double requisite \"composition-structure\", the complete melting, processing and heat treatment cycle must be controlled. Any non-compliance with specifications during melting cannot generally be corrected at a later stage, and will lead to a poor quality product. Since it is impossible to give an exhaustive coverage, this paper will focus on the 4 remelting processes (VAR, ESR, EBM, EBCHR). Certain phenomena will be particularly emphasised in each of them. I1 THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICAL MODELLING The melting and remelting processes are complex and are characterized by a number of features which make in-situ measurements difficult : high temperatures, the reactivity of the alloys, the important contribution of heterogeneous reactions. In this context, mathematical modelling based on physical-chemical phenomena offers a means of investigation which is often irreplaceable, provided that it is closely associated with laboratory measurements and experimental validations. The capacity of present-day computers enables the treatment of ever more complex phenomena and geometries. Numerous calculation codes are commercially available, but the user can also choose to develop his own programs. The numerical methods employed are varied and powerful. Examples are the finite difference, finite volume and finite element techniques. I11 VACUUM ARC REMELTING : control of the structure and com~osition of the allovs uroduced ; optimization of the operatine conditions. The VAR process is used for the production of special steels and nickel or cobalt base alloys for the aircraft industry. It also represents the final stage of the melting cycle for zirconium and titanium alloys. Depending on the property it is wished to obtain in the product : solidification structure, chemical homogeneity, absence of micro-shrinkage, macro-segregations or pipes, it will be necessary to control different types of phenomena (thermal, hydrodynamic, matter transfer, interface reactions, etc.) (figure 1). 1) Thermal modellinp, of the incot : minimization of the local solidification time. A simple thermal model of the ingot enables the temperature distribution to be determined at any instant, thus indicating the position of the shrinkage pipe and allowing evaluation of the local solidification time (1.s.t.). The 1.s.t. is defined as the time taken for a given point in the ingot to cool from the liquidus temperature to the temperature corresponding to the end of solidification. It is directly related to structural parameters such as the interdendritic spacings. In general, the larger the I.s.t., the coarser the structure. Models of this type have been in use for many years. These models have been validated by deliberately marking the liquid pool during remelting operations in both pilot and industrial furnaces. With models of this sort, it is possible to determine the operating conditions which lead to a minimum local solidification time in a given ingot. This is done by calculating the variation of the Ls-t. under the last liquid pool as a function of the melting rate. The position of the minimum 1.s.t. indicates the optimum melting rate to be employed.

The coexistence of the liquid and solid phases in the VAR process leads to a zone refining phenomenon. This causes axial segregation of the alloying elements on the scale of the ingot. For the titanium alloys used in aircraft engines, this segregation results in a scatter in the a-P uansus temperature, which is strongly dependent on chemical composition. In order to control this critical parameter, the company Cezus, in collaboration with the Nancy School of Mines, developed a model for calculating the charge compensation required to minimise the final macrosegregation. The model is of the two-dimensional \"zone refining\" type, in which : the solidification front is assumed to be locally planar. This assumption is sufficient for relatively lean alloys (e.g. Zy4, Zy2, TA6V). The front is then localized along a mean isotherm situated between the liquidus and the solidus. This isotherm is determined by the thermal model previously described; the melt pool is assumed to have a uniform composition, except for a diffusion layer along the solidification front; solute redistribution is characterized by an effective partition coefficient Keff. The solution of the solute conservation equation both for the solid phase and for the liquid phase, with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions, enables the variation of the ingot composition to be determined during successive remelting operations. It is thus shows that, starting with a homogeneous TA6V ingot, after 3 successive melting runs, taking care to turn the ingot over each time, the final oxygen distribution obtained is not uniform. The same calculation made for an electrode with initial compensation of the charge shows that it is possible to significantly reduce the heterogeneity. JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE IV 3) Movement in the melt pool In order to calculate the movement of the liquid metal in the melt pool, it is necessary to take into account the interaction between thermal and hydrodynamic factors. The heat transfer is represented by the heat balance : where Cp is the specific heat of the fluid, h is the thermal conductivity and Q is the energy per unit volume dissipated by resistance heating. + + The latent h q t transported by the liquid metal droplets is taken into account by the term p Cp V .VT where the velocity V represents the sum of the velocity of the liquid in the pool and the velocity of th6 droplets (advection). The turbulent thermal conductivity is calculated from the turbulent viscosity pt by considering as a first approximation that : The movements in the melt pool are represented by the momentum transfer equations for an incompressible fluid : + where P is the pressure, V is the velocity vector, p is the density of the fluid, and p is the dynamic viscosity. The force vector per unit volume, F, is equal to the sum of the gravitational and Lorentz forces : + where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The density p can vary with temperature T according to the linear law where p is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid. This signifies that the Navier-Stokes, turbulence and energy conservation equations must be solved in an interactive manner. The results obtained, for a TA6V ingot, reveal the liquid metal recirculation vortices. These can be created by two types of volume phenomena : the divergence of the electric current flux lines and the natural co", "year": 2017}

Presence in physical places can be utilised to support mobile interaction by making access to media and notifications on a smartphone easier and more visible to other people. Smartphone interfaces can be extended into the physical world in a meaningful way by anchoring digital content to artefacts, and interactions situated around physical artefacts can provide contextual meaning to private manipulations with a mobile device. Additionally, places themselves are designed to support a set of tasks, and the logical structure of places can be used to organise content on the smartphone. Menus that adapt the functionality of a smartphone can support the user by presenting the tools most likely to be needed just-in-time, so that information needs can be satisfied quickly and with little cognitive effort. Furthermore, places are often shared with people whom the user knows, and the smartphone can facilitate social situations by providing access to content that stimulates conversation. However, the smartphone can disrupt a collaborative environment, by alerting the user with unimportant notifications, or sucking the user in to the digital world with attractive content that is only shown on a private screen. Sharing smartphone content on a situated display creates an inclusive and unobtrusive user experience, and can increase focus on a primary task by allowing content to be read at a glance. \n \nMobile interaction situated around artefacts of personal places is investigated as a way to support users to access content from their smartphone while managing their physical presence. A menu that adapts to personal places is evaluated to reduce the time and effort of app navigation, and coordinating smartphone content on a situated display is found to support social engagement and the negotiation of notifications. Improving the sensing of smartphone users in places is a challenge that is out-with the scope of this thesis. Instead, interaction designers and developers should be provided with low-cost positioning tools that utilise presence in places, and enable quantitative and qualitative data to be collected in user evaluations. Two lightweight positioning tools are developed with the low-cost sensors that are currently available: The Microsoft Kinect depth sensor allows movements of a smartphone user to be tracked in a limited area of a place, and Bluetooth beacons enable the larger context of a place to be detected. Positioning experiments with each sensor are performed to highlight the capabilities and limitations of current sensing techniques for designing interactions with a smartphone. Both tools enable prototypes to be built with a rapid prototyping approach, and mobile interactions can be tested with more advanced sensing techniques as they become available. \n \nSensing technologies are becoming pervasive, and it will soon be possible to perform reliable place detection in-the-wild.

However, use of such apps has not been fully effective in supporting people with dementia and their caregivers in their daily lives. This is mainly attributed to the heterogeneous quality of mHealth apps, highlighting the need for improved app quality in the development of dementia-related mHealth apps.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aims of this study were (1) to assess the quality and content of mobile apps for dementia management and (2) to investigate the relationship between app quality and download numbers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed dementia-related mHealth apps available in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in Taiwan. The identified mobile apps were stratified according to a random sampling approach and evaluated by five independent reviewers with sufficient training and proficiency in the field of mHealth and the related health care sector. App quality was scored according to the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale. A correlation analysis was then performed between the app quality score and number of app downloads.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 17 apps that were evaluated, only one was specifically designed to provide dementia-related education.

Our analyses showed clear differences between the top three- and bottom three-rated apps, particularly in the entertainment and interest subsections of the engagement category where the ratings ranged from 1.4 to 5. The top three apps had a common feature in their interface, which included memory, attention, focus, calculation, and speed-training games, whereas the apps that received lower ratings were found to be deficient in providing adequate information.

With the improving of the software technology and the improvement of the related network infrastructure, the function of the instant communication software is also increasingly rich, in addition to the basic communication function, gradually integrated with emails, blogs, music, television, games and search and other functions, these functions have also prompted instant communication is no longer a simple chat tool, has been successful with communication, entertainment, business office and customer service features such as the integration of information platform. Instant communication tools, real-time interaction and rates is low wait for an advantage, gradually popular with users, has become an integral part of the network life. Netizens communicating through instant communication, making new friends, entertainment time, implement different text, files, voice, videos, real-time communication exchange. At the same time, people also realize that instant messaging tools can bring high productivity. As the most frequently used network software, instant messaging is breakthrough the limit as a technical tool, is considered to be the new symbol of modern way of communication. In this paper, based on the Socket technology research, for the development of new instant messaging software provides design scheme. Socket Technology The two programs on the network through a two-way communication link for data exchange, one end of the connection is called a Socket. To distinguish different application processes and connection, the operating system for the application and the TC/IP protocol interaction provides a Socket interface, to distinguish the different network communication and the connection between the application processes. Generate a socket, there should be three parameters: communication destination IP address, the transport layer protocol and port number. Socket's original intention is \"outlet\", combine the three parameters, and a \"Socket\" Socket binding, can application layer and transport layer through a Socket interface, distinguish from different application process or network 3rd International Conference on Management, Education Technology and Sports Science (METSS 2016) \u00a9 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 519 connection communication, realize the data transmission of concurrent service. To communicate via the Internet, at least need a pair of sockets, a run on the client side, called ClientSocket; And another run on the server side, called ServerSocket. Connect according to start the way and the local socket to connect the target, the socket can be divided into the connection between the process servers monitoring, client requests and connect to confirm three steps. Monitoring, among them, the server is in a state of waiting for the connection, the real-time monitoring network state; Client request, the client socket connection request is put forward, is to connect the server socket; Connection, the server socket listening to client socket connection request, send the description of the server socket to the client. The Socket is a bridge between the client and the server, as shown in Fig. 1. Briefly Requirement Analysis Systems analysts to identify the needs of users, comprehensive and modeling, clear user requirements of vagueness, ambiguity and inconsistencies, and data analysis system, this software logic model is set up for the original problem and target. Analysis personnel to the understanding of the original problem with software development experience, in order to find what requirement is due to the user's partial or short-term behavior caused by the unreasonable requirement, which is the user has not been proposed but the potential demand of real value. Demand analysis is important, because have the function of the decision-making, directivity, strategic, has a pivotal position in the software development process. Requirement analysis is an effective way to get users demand, demand analysis is the key factor that decides the success of the project, the requirements analysis is the bridge of system analysis and software design, requirement analysis is an important stage of software quality control. Demand analysis, should pay attention to all information and the demand are standing in the user's point of view, try to avoid the analyst's subjective imagination, try to analysis schedule submitted to the user. On the premise of not direct guidance, let the user for inspection and evaluation, ensures the accuracy of demand analysis. In communication system based on Socket, the client and the server keep connection. This way to connect is in different way comparing general web browsing. When using a browser to access the server, first made by the client network communication protocol, then the server response processing, and returns the processing result, the request and response is causal relationship between before and after the point to point. And based on Socket communication system, the client communication information at the same time, the client is also in many other communication information server, therefore, requesting and response without corresponding relations between before and after, are two separate processes, respectively.

When the ad viewer opens an ad, the system analyzes and matches a human ad assistant who may be capable of describing the product/service to the user. The system may match ad viewers to ad assistants based on viewer-selected preferences (e.g. talkativeness, personality type, language, cognitive abilities). The online ad viewer could then interact with the ad assistant through a webcam in real-time. The system tailors an online ad experience with a human touch which may lead to more confident purchases by the customer end and makes advertisements more efficient. The system may also provide online job opportunities to those willing to serve as ad assistants across the globe. BACKGROUND Online ads are relatively inefficient and miss an important human element. The online advertising ecosystem or online ads and related ads specifically are largely inefficient. By their design (including format, length, text limits, image size, costs), they are highly constrained and limited as information conduits. Most of the online buyers may be open to or may consider the opportunity to speak to a real human to buy something online. At present there are services that may connect people who need services to people who may provide those services but there are no ad integrations real time features, or product-integrated treatments. There is information asymmetry for most people evaluating products/services covered in an ad. The ad may not convey all the necessary information because a single ad does not fit all needs for all people. Ads may stand to be more helpful, human and efficient by providing better 2 Ruxton and Ivester: In-Ad Real-Time Video Communication And Assisted Selling Published by Technical Disclosure Commons, 2017 or more relevant information. From the customer side, there is a demand for more product information and human communication to fill in the gaps that ads undeniably leave. DESCRIPTION A system and method are disclosed that enables an online real-time ad viewer to communicate with an ad assistant who may help the viewer with information about the product. The system includes an online ad viewer interacting with an ad assistant through a webcam in a real-time ad and also matches the best ad assistant suited to interact with the user for the realtime ad viewed by the user or ad viewer as shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1: In-ad real time video communication This method includes an in-ad video communication portal feature and the matching criteria and process that trigger the best match ad viewer and ad assistant. When the user views an online ad, the system connects an ad viewer (i.e. the user) to an ad assistant which may 3 Defensive Publications Series, Art. 563 [2017] http://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/563 describe the product currently viewed. The system filters the ad assistant based on several criteria to match the best ad assistant to the user. The system may match ad viewers to ad assistants based on viewer-selected preferences (e.g. talkativeness, personality type, language, cognitive abilities) which leads to a more fitting and relevant experience for the ad viewer. The user may communicate with the ad assistant to seek advice or product information as shown in FIG. 2. The user may purchase the product with an increased level of confidence. FIG. 2: Method to enable real time video communication between ad assistant and ad viewer The system provides a platform that connects ad assistants (exemplarily people who want to earn money selling their favorite product(s)) with the right ad viewers (exemplarily, people who willingly view online ads). They may have internet access, and may be familiar with commonly advertised products. The system may work through ad platforms via a video chat on 4 Ruxton and Ivester: In-Ad Real-Time Video Communication And Assisted Selling Published by Technical Disclosure Commons, 2017 any device, so that ad viewers may interact with ad assistants to learn more about the product or service being advertised. The system includes an in-ad feature to match these people or \u2018ad assistants\u2019 to ad viewers or \u2018customers\u2019, when those customers need more information about a product being advertised. The system may further provide a rating mechanism for users to rate their experience with the ad assistant through an in-ad user interface. The rating may be on a 5 star or other suitable scale presented immediately after the session ends, or may be collected from the user through a follow up mini-survey. The system also provides a mechanism for online advertisers to manage or actively curate the portfolio of ad assistants who represent their company. The system allows advertisers to control of the quality and number of ad assistants who appear within their ads. The system may also enable advertisers to remove those that may damage their brand or be non representative of their values, based on metrics and or reviews of their sales sessions. Social platforms may offer users who love a certain product (deduced, for example, by their social platform usage and follow preferences) a commission-based job for helping ad viewers make more confident ad purchases. A mobile-only version of this may be created, where the ad feature may not be directly built on top of an ad platform. A separate \u2018ad assistant\u2019 application may potentially run in the background and activate this kind of service when ads pop up elsewhere. For example, if the user is using a social media platform and sees an ad for a snowboard, a built-in application may notify the user so that they may speak to the social media user (ad assistant) with 10 years of snowboarding experience for a fee. This system and method optimizes the match between the viewer and the assistant to result in a more efficient, tailored and human online ad experience. This platform may serve to make every customer ad engagement more efficient for both customers and advertisers.

In the acquisition stage, omnidirectional videos are taken along streets in target areas. Frames of the video are localized on the map, intersections are detected, and videos are segmented. Turning views at intersections are subsequently generated. By connecting the video segments following the specified movement in an area, we can view the streets better. The interface allows for easy exploration of a target area, and it can show virtual billboards of stores in the view.

Robotics is another area that can benefit from these recent technologies. In fact, most of the current and futuristic robotic applications, namely, the areas related to advanced manufacturing tasks (e.g. additive-manufacturing, collaborative robotics, etc.), require new technics to actually perceive the result of several actions, including programming tasks, anticipate trajectories, visualize the motion and related information, interface with programmers and users and several other human\u2013machine interfaces. Consequently, this paper aims to explain a new concept of human\u2013machine interfaces aiming to improve the interaction between advanced users and industrial robotic work cells.,The presented concept uses two different applications (apps) developed to explore the advanced features of the Microsoft HoloLens device. The objectives of the project reported in this paper are to optimize robot paths, just by allowing the advanced user to adjust the selected path through the mixed reality environment, and create new paths, just by allowing the advanced user to insert points in the mixed reality environment, correct them as needed, connect them using a certain type of motion, parametrize them (in terms of velocity, motion precision, etc.) and command them to the robot controller.,The solutions demonstrated in this paper show how mixed reality can be used to allow users, with limited programming experience, to fully use the robotics fields. They also show clearly that the integration of the mixed reality technology in the current robot systems will be a turning point in reducing the complexity for end-users.,There are two challenges in the developed applications. The first relates to the robot tool identification, which is very sensitive to lighting conditions or to very complex robot tools. This can result in positioning errors when the software shows the path in the mixed reality scene. The paper presents solutions to overcome this problem. Another unattended challenge is associated with handling the robot singularities when adjusting or creating new paths. Ongoing work is concentrated in creating mechanisms that prevent the end-user to create paths that contain unreachable points or paths that are not feasible because of bad motion parameters.,This paper demonstrates the utilization of mixed reality device to improve the tasks of programming and commanding manufacturing work cells based on industrial robots [see video in (Pires et al., 2018)]. As the presented devices and robot cells are the basis for Industry 4.0 objectives, this demonstration has a vast field of application in the near future, positively influencing the way complex applications, that require much close cooperation between humans and machines, are thought, planned and built. The paper presents two different applications fully ready to use in industrial environments. These applications are scientific experiments designed to demonstrate the principles and technologies of mixed reality applied to industrial robotics, namely, for improving the programming task.,Although the HoloLens device opens outstanding new areas for robot command and programming, it is still expensive and somehow heavy for everyday use. Consequently, this opens an opportunity window to combine these devices with other mobile devices, such as tablets and phones, building applications that take advantage of their combined features.,The paper presents two different applications fully ready to use in industrial environments. These applications are scientific experiments designed to demonstrate the principles and technologies of mixed reality applied to industrial robotics, namely, for improving the programming task. The first application is about path visualization, i.e. enables the user to visualize, in a mixed reality environment, any path preplanned for the robot cell. With this feature, the advanced user can follow the robot path, identify problems, associate any difficulty in the final product with a particular issue in the robot paths, anticipate execution problems with impact on the final product quality, etc. This is particularly important for not only advanced applications, but also for cases where the robot path results from a CAD package (in an offline fashion). The second application consists of a graphical path manipulation procedure that allows the advanced user to create and optimize a robot path. Just by exploring this feature, the end-user can adjust any path obtained from any programming method, using the mixed reality approach to guide (visually) the path manipulation procedure. It can also create a completely new path using a process of graphical insertion of point positions and paths into the mixed reality scene.

Many social science and business journals are receiving studies that utilize crowdsourcing tools such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), Qualtrics, MicroWorkers, ShortTask, ClickWorker, and Crowdsource (e.g., Ahn, & Back, 2019; Ali et al., 2021; Esfahani, & Ozturk, 2019; Jeong, & Lee, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Even though the use of these tools presents a great opportunity for sharing large quantities of data quickly, some challenges must also be addressed. The purpose of this guide is to present the basic ideas behind the use of crowdsourcing for survey research and provide a primer for best practices that will increase their validity and reliability.\n \n What is crowdsourcing research?\n \n Crowdsourcing describes the collection of information, opinions, or other types of input from a large number of people, typically via the internet, and which may or may not receive (financial) compensation (Hargrave, 2019; Oxford Dictionary, n.d.). Within the behavioral science realm, crowdsourcing is defined as the use of internet services for hosting research activities and for creating opportunities for a large population of participants. Applications of crowdsourcing techniques have evolved over the decades, establishing the strong informational power of crowds. The advent of Web 2.0 has expanded the possibilities of crowdsourcing, with new online tools such as online reviews, forums, Wikipedia, Qualtrics, or MTurk, but also other platforms such as Crowdflower and Prolific Academic (Peer et al., 2017; Sheehan, 2018).\n Crowdsourcing platforms in the age of Web 2.0 use remote labor recruited via the internet to assist employers complete tasks that cannot be left to machines. Key characteristics of crowdsourcing include payment for workers, their recruitment from any location, and the completion of tasks (Behrend et al., 2011). They also allow for a relatively quick collection of data compared to data collection in the field, and participants are rewarded with an incentive\u2014often financial compensation. Crowdsourcing not only offers a large participation pool but also a streamlined process for the study design, participant recruitment, and data collection as well as integrated participant compensation system (Buhrmester et al., 2011). Also, compared to other traditional marketing firms, crowdsourcing makes it easier to detect possible sampling biases (Garrow et al., 2020). Due to advantages such as reduced costs, diversity of participants, and flexibility, crowdsourcing platforms have surged in popularity for researchers.\n \n Advantages\n \n MTurk is one of the most popular crowdsourcing platforms among researchers, allowing Requesters to submit tasks for Workers to complete (Cummings & Sibona, 2017). MTurk has been used as an online crowdsourcing platform for the recruitment of human subjects for research purposes (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014). Research has also shown MTurk to be a reliable and cost-effective tool, capable of providing representative data for research in the behavioral sciences (e.g., Crump et al., 2013; Goodman et al., 2013; Mason & Suri, 2012; Rand, 2012; Simcox & Fiez, 2014). In addition to its use in social science studies, the platform has been used in marketing, hospitality and tourism, psychology, political science, communication, and sociology contexts (Sheehan, 2018). To illustrate, between 2012 and 2017, more than 40% of the studies published in the Journal of Consumer Research used crowdsourcing websites for their data collection (Goodman & Paolacci, 2017).\n \n Disadvantages\n \n Although researchers have assessed crowdsourcing platforms as reliable and cost-effective for data collection in the behavioral sciences, they are not exempt of flaws. One disadvantage is the possibility of unsatisfactory data quality. In fact, the virtual setting of the survey implies that the investigator is physically separated from the participant, and this lack of monitoring could lead to data quality issues (Sheehan, 2018). In addition, participants in survey research on crowdsourcing platforms are not always who they claim to be, creating issues of trust with the data provided and, ultimately, the quality of the research findings (McGonagle, 2015; Smith et al., 2016).\n A recurrent concern with MTurk workers, for instance, is their assessment as experienced survey takers (Chandler et al., 2015). This experience is mainly acquired through completion of dozens of surveys per day, especially when they are faced with similar items and scales. Smith et al. (2016) identified two types of problems performing data collection using MTurk; namely, cheaters and speeders. As compared to Qualtrics\u2014which has a strict screening and quality-control processes to ensure that participants are who they claim to be\u2014MTurk appears to be less exigent regarding the workers. However, a downside for data collection with Qualtrics is more expensive fees\u2014about $5.00 per questionnaire on Qualtrics, against $0.50 to $1.50 on MTurk (Ford, 2017). Hence, few researchers were able to conduct surveys and compare respondent pools with Qualtrics or other traditional marketing research firms (Garrow et al., 2020).\n Another challenge using MTurk arises when trying to collect a desired number of responses from a population targeted to a specific city or area (Ross et al., 2010). The issues inherent to the selection process of MTurk have been the subject of investigations in several studies (e.g., Berinsky et al., 2012; Chandler et al., 2014; 2015; Harms & DeSimone, 2015; Paolacci et al., 2010; Rand, 2012). Feitosa et al. (2015) pointed out that international respondents may still identify themselves as U.S. respondents with the use of fake addresses and accounts. They found that 5% to 10% of participants identifying themselves as U.S. respondents were actually from overseas locations. Moreover, Babin et al. (2016) assessed that the use of trap questions allowed researchers to uncover that many respondents change their genders, ages, careers, or income within the course of a single survey. The issues of (a) experienced workers for the quality control of questions and (b) speeders, which, for MTurk can be attributed to the platform being the main source of revenue for a given respondent, remain the inherent issues of crowdsourcing platforms used for research purposes.\n \n Best practices\n \n Some best practices can be recommended in the use of crowdsourcing platforms for data collection purposes. Workers IDs can be matched with IDs from previous studies, thus allowing researchers to exclude responses from workers who had answered previous similar studies (Goodman & Paolacci, 2017). Furthermore, proceed to a manual assignment of qualification on MTurk prior to data collection (Litman et al., 2015; Park & Park, 2020). When dealing with experienced workers, both using multiple attention checks and optimizing the survey in a way to have the participants exposed to the stimuli for a sufficient length of time to better address the questions are also recommended (Sheehan, 2018). In this sense, shorter surveys are preferred to longer ones, which affect the participant\u2019s concentration, and may, in turn, adversely impact the quality of their answers. Most importantly, pretest the survey to make sure that all parts are working as expected.\n Researchers should also keep in mind that in the context of MTurk, the primary method for measurement is the web interface. Thus, to avoid method biases, researchers should ponder whether or not method factors emerge in the latent measurement models (Podsakoff et al., 2012). As such, time-lagged research designs may be preferred as predictor and criterion variables can be measured at different points in time or administered in different platforms, such as Qualtrics vs MTurk (Cheung et al., 2017). In general, the use of crowdsourcing platforms including MTurk may be appropriate according to the research question; and the quality of data is reliant on the quality-control strategies used by researchers to enhance data quality. Trade-offs between various validity types need to be prioritized according to the research objectives (Cheung et al., 2017).\n From our experience using crowdsourcing tools for our own research as the editorial team members of several journals and chair of several conferences, we provide the best practices as outlined below:\n \n MTurk Worker (Respondent) Selection:\n \n \n Researchers should consider their study population before using MTurk for data collection. The MTurk platform should be used for the appropriate study population. For example, if the study targets restaurant owners or company CEOs, MTurk workers may not be suitable for the study. However, if the target population is diners, hotel guests, grocery shoppers, online shoppers, students, or hourly employees, utilizing a sample from MTurk would be suitable.\n \n Researchers should use the selection tool in the software. For example, if you target workers only from one country, exclude responses that came from an internet protocol (IP) address outside the targeted country and report the results in the method section.\n Researchers should consider the demographics of workers on MTurk which must reflect the study targeted population. For example, if the study focuses on baby boomers use of technology, then the MTurk sample should include only baby boomers. Similarly, the gender balance, racial composition, and income of people on MTurk should mirror the targeted population.\n Researchers should use multiple screening tools that identify quality respondents and avoid problematic response patterns. For example, MTurk provides the approval rate for the respondents. This refers to how many times a respondent is rejected for various reasons (i.e., wrong code entered). We recommend using a 90% or higher approv", "year": 2021}

What\u2019s more, the intentions of contributing online reviews for most of customers may be influenced by their national culture for global e-commerce platforms. Motivated by such concerns, a theoretical model is formulated and tested, which can explain and compare national cultural difference of consumer reviews intention. The model is validated through an online survey. The results reveal that the perceived usefulness, reciprocity, reputation and review cost significantly impact consumer online reviews intention both in China and the USA, while economic rewards and perceived ease of use show little impact on consumer reviews intention significantly. And the group analysis indicates that the national cultural difference exists in the customers\u2019 reviews intention. Then related managerial implications for e-commerce platform enterprises are discussed in the end. Introduction It is very important for e-commerce platforms and e-business enterprises to have or design a good customer reviews system. Customer reviews will not only impact on sales of the goods and services, but also reduce the uncertainty of consumer purchases. Online consumer reviews have become the most important basis for customers\u2019 online shopping decisions. However, most of online shoppers are not willing to share their consumption experiences actively at e-commerce platforms for different reasons, such as privacy security, review costs, etc. How to effectively encourage consumers to write and post their consumption experiences actively at the customer review system of the e-commerce platforms, which is very necessary for e-business enterprises. To solve the problem, we should understand and interpret the motivation of customers contributing product reviews. What\u2019s more, It is obviously that cultural differences exist in the user behavior. We would like to know whether there are also national cultural differences in the customers\u2019 reviews motivations. Literature Review With the development of technology and network, user generated contents like product reviews have become more and more popular on the internet. While literature about the motivation of customer reviews is relatively few. Hennig-Thurau et al. (2004) is an early representative document of the research on the motivation of user's word of mouth, which revealed the primary motivation of user e-word-of-mouth communication, including social interaction, economic rewards, altruism, and reputation[1]. Munzel and Kunz (2014) showed that online users perceived a social debt to give something back to the online reviews system, which can be called reciprocity[2]. While review cost, such as consuming time, taking efforts and privacy security, sometimes impact on the contributing intentions of online reviewers. Some papers indicated that the review cost had a significant negative effect on the motivation of posting contents[3,4].

There is a negotiation of intent between users and systems via discrete combinations of controls with fairly constrained yet recognizable behaviors: buttons, tabs, switches, dials, text fields, icons, and so forth\u2014both pixeland atom-based. Such elements make up the interface, helping users accomplish some task that may occur across a range of forms or screens. Sure, it all seems quite complex, yet it\u2019s fairly direct and tangible. To put it bluntly, there is something there to interact with. It may not be entirely comprehensible, but it\u2019s embodied and visceral, with some perceptible affordance and feedback. Yet today we are speeding toward a new frontier for HCI, where the computational aspect is no longer quite so... there. It even seems to have a mind of its own that evolves over time, anticipating and predicting actions or desired outcomes, supposedly on our behalf. I am of course referring to the current pervasive rise of AI: enhanced algorithms built via machineand deeplearning systems that thrive on cloudbased networks, copious crowdsourced data, and (perhaps) some momentary human interventions to help correct any errors along the way. Whether embedded within self-driving cars or the much-hyped Internet of Things (IoT), conversational interfaces, voicebased virtual assistants, and predictive analytics are all profoundly altering the nature of computing. Consider the expanding gamut of algorithmically driven experiences. Netflix\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s recommendation systems quietly started this shift, and then Siri exploded into pop-cultural consciousness. Before long we had the Nest learning thermostat adjusting your \u201ccomfort level,\u201d Google Now suggesting when to leave for your appointment, Tesla pushing overnight updates for selfparking and lane-switching, and Amy the x.ai virtual assistant coordinating meetings with real people (or maybe their own bots?). This ain\u2019t Clippy anymore, haughtily presuming you\u2019re writing a letter to Mom! Things have certainly... evolved. Indeed, these systems seem to function on their own via an opaque, hidden animating force. They go deeper into the sphere of interaction, following inscrutable rules of behavior whose limits or capabilities are rather vague to regular folks\u2014yet seem to be changing as they \u201clearn.\u201d How does one make sense of and engage intelligently with these systems underlying so-called smart objects or interfaces? How do we handle them as HCI professionals, applying our core UX principles and practices? Indeed, what does it mean to design for the human-algorithmic experience? This strikes at the core of HCI\u2019s role in this emerging world. Perhaps there\u2019s a clue in the recent uproar over Twitter changing its timeline stream to be algorithmic, from the previous model where posts are set in reverse chronological order. Facebook is clearly algorithmically driven\u2014we all complain about seeing the same five friends\u2019 posts in our feed, despite having more than 250 friends, right? Interspersed with ads, ads, ads! All of which muddies (and sullies) their intents, seemingly driven by ad sales revenue, not \u201cbringing the world closer.\u201d The experience becomes a mystery. Instead of joyous serendipity, there\u2019s some dubious manipulation, shifting the dynamic and eroding trust and respect for the product\u2014or at least creating some cynical notion of online friends. Many users want Twitter to be a pure, unadulterated feed with transparent clarity in how it behaves, setting expectations for the behavioral model and thus how to interpret the content it presents. What the Facebook activity feed vs. Twitter timeline order suggests is this: The nuances of the user-product relationship have been subtly distorted. Algorithms are being woven into the fabric of daily life, influencing how we choose a movie, research medication, and book a flight. Who is in control, or controlling whom? Is the point to improve the human condition or to make a buck? This may lead to users trying out maneuvers for coping and compensating (i.e., gaming the system) to somehow circumvent or manipulate the algorithm, complicating the relationship even further. How the system behaves quietly yet powerfully shapes our responses and implicit values therein. Throw in some mysterious (and presumably IP-protected) \u201csmarts\u201d and things get messy, fast! That product relationship no longer feels natural. The seams are exposed; the fabric of digital life is fraying at the edges. So, algorithms clearly add interesting dimensions to HCI practice. How do we judiciously shape such encounters to be more positive and clear for both the user and the algorithm, in a balanced dialogue where interaction creates value. I would boldly suggest that to properly enable this, we must empathize with the algorithm! What does that mean? Let me clarify. I\u2019m not saying HCI experts need to program these smart algorithms. We must leave that to the experts in machine-learning protocols.", "year": 2016}

This paper presents findings of exploratory analysis of the data collected in this test. Clustering of day patterns from FMS data reveals large day-to-day variability of user behavior, which cannot be captured by a snapshot with a one-day survey. Even the high crosssectional variability from the larger sample size of a traditional survey would not have achieved the comprehensive set of heterogeneous patterns as provided by FMS. Some common problems in traditional surveys \u2013 such as under-reporting of trips, over-estimation of travel times, and inaccuracy of locations and times \u2013 can apparently be reduced by FMS. The FMS data, as compared to HITS, have higher resolution and better accuracy. In addition, FMS is well suited to collect multi-day data as additional costs are marginal and user burden reduces over time. FMS offers a promising technology for next generation travel data collection. Zhao, Pereira, Ball, Kim, Han, Zegras, Ben-Akiva 3 INTRODUCTION The unprecedented and increasing penetration rate of smartphones together with advances in mobile sensing technology have greatly expanded the means of collecting various forms of personal transportation data. Traditional self-reported travel surveys typically suffer from problems such as limited sample size, under-reporting of total completed trips, imprecision in reported trip start and end times (1). Smartphone-based surveys present the opportunity to collect more detailed and precise data needed for emerging agent and activity-based behavioral models. Developments in this field (2, 3) suggest that location-enabled technologies can reduce the number of erroneous \u201cno travel\" days and missed trips; improve accuracy of reported trip times, locations and paths; and, reduce respondent burden. The usage of mobile technologies for automatic surveying is not new. GPS-based logging surveys have been widely implemented worldwide and largely successful as a supplement to traditional household travel surveys (4, 5, 6, 7). However, pure GPS logging suffers from some limitations. Financially, the agencies conducting travel surveys must purchase and distribute the GPS collection devices, which can be a significant investment. Also, the participants may forget to carry the GPS loggers with them for the duration of the travel survey, and they may still face a recollection problem when completing their travel diary. In contrast, smartphones provide some clear benefits. For instance, users are accustomed to carrying their phones with them constantly, with adequate battery life, thus decreasing the likelihood of missing trips. Furthermore, smartphones contain a combination of sensors \u2013 such as Bluetooth, WiFi, accelerometers, and GPS \u2013 which expand upon pure positioning data, providing a richness which can be used to infer activity and mode information. These attributes make smartphones ideal \u201clife-loggers.\u201d The Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) system capitalizes on these \u201clife-logging\u201d capabilities in a next-generation travel survey system, leveraging increasingly pervasive smartphones, advanced sensing and communication technologies and a machine learning architecture (8). With a web-based prompted recall user interface, FMS delivers a previously unobtainable range of data, more closely reflecting what people do, not what they say they do. FMS was field-tested in Singapore in conjunction with the Singapore Land Transport Authority\u2019s (LTA\u2019s) Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) 2012. The pilot recruited more than 1500 users and produced a large set of rich and detailed travel/activity data, validated by the respondents (9). This paper reports on the exploratory analysis of this unique dataset, demonstrating the capabilities of this kind of survey platform to reveal interesting and diverse user day patterns and overcome some of the known issues of traditional travel surveys. The remainder this paper has five parts. Section 2 gives an overview of the FMS system. Section 3 describes the field test with the HITS survey in Singapore and the data collected. Section 4 presents an example to illustrate the difference between the data collected in HITS and FMS. Section 5 presents the exploratory analysis results and the final section concludes. FMS SYSTEM FMS consists of three separate, but inter-connected, components: the smartphone app that collects the sensing data; the server that includes the database as well as the data processing and learning algorithms; and the web interface that users access to view and validate the processed data and answer additional questions to supplement the validated data. Figure 1 shows three components and the data flows among them. Zhao, Pereira, Ball, Kim, Han, Zegras, Ben-Akiva 4 Smartphone App The smartphone app, available for both Android and iOS platforms, collects data from a multitude of the phones\u2019 sensors, including GPS, GSM, accelerometer, and WiFi. A major design objective of the FMS app is non-intrusiveness, i.e., the app runs in the background of the phone, silently collecting sensor data without user intervention. This aims to minimize the app\u2019s influence on participants during their normal daily activities. In addition, the application is designed to be lightweight (in terms of memory use), easy to use, and energy efficient, using various approaches to minimize battery consumption (10), a major concern for location-based applications. The sensor data collected on the phone are transferred to the back-end server through either the cellular network or WiFi, based on the user\u2019s preference. Backend Server Raw data collected via the app are uploaded to a database where a series of algorithms are used to process the data and make inferences about stops, travel modes and non-travel activities (11). To minimize the user\u2019s interaction burden, the backend algorithms translate raw data into trips and activities. The first round of stop detection is made based on location and point-of-interest (POI) data. GSM, WiFi and accelerometer information are used to merge stops that would otherwise be interpreted as distinct stops. Travel modes are detected based on GPS and accelerometer features, as well as public transit location information. Short duration stops that are unimportant from a data validation standpoint (such as stops in traffic) are deleted for the purposes of presentation in the web interface. Travel destinations (e.g., home, work, shopping, drop-off) are also inferred based on previous validations by the user, POI data, and other contextual information. Web-interface The web interface provides a platform that enables users to review and \u201cvalidate\u201d their processed data in the form of a daily timeline or activity diary (Figure 2). Validation involves filling in missing information and amending incorrectly inferred data about modes of travel used for particular trips and specific activities engaged in at inferred \u201cstop\u201d locations (destinations). The validated data are uploaded and the algorithms learn from the user validations to subsequently make better inferences. The website is flexibly designed to enable supplementary data collection, such as information pertaining to a specific trip (e.g., how many people the user traveled with or what, if any, fee was paid for parking), during the activity diary validation stage. The LTA pilot involved a helpdesk made available to users through a web-chat or phone call; users were encouraged to have a session with a helpdesk representative for assistance during their first data validation.", "year": 2016}

Amid this e-commerce boom, accurately predicting user purchase behavior has become crucial for commercial success. We introduce a novel framework integrating three innovative approaches to enhance the prediction model\u2019s effectiveness. First, we integrate an event-based timestamp encoding within a time-series attention model, effectively capturing the dynamic and temporal aspects of user behavior. This aspect is often neglected in traditional user purchase prediction methods, leading to suboptimal accuracy. Second, we incorporate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze user behavior. By modeling users and their actions as nodes and edges within a graph structure, we capture complex relationships and patterns in user behavior more effectively than current models, offering a nuanced and comprehensive analysis. Lastly, our framework transcends traditional learning strategies by implementing advanced meta-learning techniques. This enables the model to autonomously adjust learning parameters, including the learning rate, in response to new and evolving data environments, thereby significantly enhancing its adaptability and learning efficiency. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world e-commerce datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance, particularly in accuracy and adaptability in large-scale data scenarios.

In this work, we investigate the influence of the location of haptic feedback devices on embodiment of virtual hands and user load during an interactive pick-and-place task. To do this, we conducted a user study with a 3x2 repeated measure experiment design: feedback position is varied between the distal phalanx of the index finger and the thumb, the proximal phalanx of the index finger and the thumb, and the wrist. These conditions of feedback are tested with the stimuli applied synchronously to the participant in one case, and with an additional delay of 350\u00a0ms in the second case. The results show that the location of the haptic feedback device does not affect embodiment, whereas the delay, i.e., whether the feedback is applied synchronously or asynchronously, affects embodiment. This suggests that for pick-and-place tasks, haptic feedback devices can be placed on the user's wrist without compromising performance making the hands to remain free, allowing unobstructed hand visibility for precise motion tracking, thereby improving accuracy.", "year": 2023}

Nowadays, people, especially the young, spend a lot of time playing different subgenres of games. Serious games, games that expand the traditional notion of gaming and have a different purpose other than pure entertainment, can be used in Computer Science education and propose a different type of learning and discussing relevant topics. Games are not only used in many ways in computer science education but also consist of a great part of students\u2019 extracurricular activities. The main purpose of serious games sessions is to put their suitability to the test and discuss whether they can be considered as an efficient teaching method. The challenge of digital serious games is to identify which of these are most effective in meeting educational outcomes, enriching computing education and fitting into existing teaching methods. In serious games, we can define points of interest like player\u2019s role, functionality, level of engagement, connection to other players, etc. Using and tweaking these dimensions we can thereafter produce not only an educational outcome but also an approach towards Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) methods and techniques. This Master Thesis targets to analyze serious games for Computer Science education in two ways: 1) for their design elements and 2) for the evaluation of their effectiveness. While thinking of the design elements, one can decide upon them by analyzing the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics of the game. All of them are essential and valuable parts of game design and comprise interconnected and interrelated concepts. Also, the main aim of the study is to focus on the design, development, and evaluation of different subgenres of games. The initial approach is to design, develop and evaluate  games that will consist of different interfaces, but both are designed and developed for software developers and target accordingly fundamental programming concepts. Participants of the experiments will be users with an elementary knowledge of programming that will be invited to play one of the subgenres of the game with randomly assigned interfaces and activities. The effectiveness of each game genre will be evaluated concerning the interface by using experimental methods and conducting interviews with the participants asking their opinions regarding the comprehensibility of each game genre.

The aim was to improve outcomes for clients with dual diagnosis (co-occurring mental health and substance misuse) issues. The purpose of the change in working practice was to engage with local substance misuse agencies more effectively to improve clinical outcomes within this service user group. This was achieved through four interrelated approaches. This comprising providing an integrated service. It included building relationships with substance misuse services, providing specialist dual diagnosis clinics and the introduction of substance misuse workers onto mental health wards and group work specific to substance misuse. The outcomes included easier access to services for service users and greater uptake of service users who were moving onto substance misuse services. This led to a reduction in risk related to prescribing and fewer incidents related to prescribing changes and greater engagement in services. When service users were moving between services better communication led to prescriptions being transferred with no delay and to reduced dropout rates in service. There was improved access to substance misuse services, more referrals and take up of service taking place. There was a greater understanding by staff of co-occurring substance misuse and how to work with this client group. Closer working relationship with substance misuse services and shared skills led to greater confidence in managing this service user group. This demonstrates a cost effective service that can be replicated within similar settings.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn clinical practice, shared treatment has proved challenging in light of different service models (Laker, 2006). Substance misuse works on the premise of change comes from the individual, where recovery models in mental health offer a formalised approach. One of the challenges faced by services has been the inability for mental health services to recruit and services become overstretched (Rimmer, 2018); this gave an opportunity for a new method of working to be considered. This led to the development of a new service model.\nThese changes were:\n\u2022 Improving the interface with substance misuse services to improve access to community substance misuse services for mental health clients.\n\u2022 To provide specialist staff within the dual diagnosis field to provide a clinic jointly with local drug and alcohol services.\n\u2022 Introduction of substance misuse workers as team members on acute mental health and rehab wards.\n\u2022 Group Substance Misuse programmes.\n\n\nFindings\nWorking within an integrated model, yet maintaining separate organisations, by offering joint training and clinics has led to a greater understanding of each organisation\u2019s work and increased engagement within the service user group.The introduction of substance misuse workers to acute and rehab mental health inpatient services encouraged service users to engage at the point of admission and to be referred into locally commissioned substance misuse services prior to the point of discharge. Engagement with staff has demonstrated better engagement with substance service by service users following discharge.For clients able to take leave assessment could take place prior to discharge. This led to an increased uptake in services. Due to no opiate substitution given on discharge decreased risk of prescribed medication overdose at point of discharge and led to increase in returning straight to substance misuse services. This meant that service users received medication quicker and the right dose and on discharge ensured reduced risk. The prescribing of Naloxone at discharge is yet to be assessed, but the risk of an overdose within seven\u2009days is well-documented and Naloxone is key in reversing this trend. This change in practice can be replicated in any mental health setting and has increased access to services for those using substances.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nIs original no other services have substance workers or joint clinics across the UK. First inpatient unit to welcome patients back post-discharge to attend groups.\n", "year": 2021}

Despite the great potential, today\u2019s MOOCs also suffer from challenges such as low student engagement, lack of personalization, and most importantly, lack of direct, immediate feedback channels from students to instructors. This dissertation explores the use of physiological signals implicitly collected via a \"sensorless\" approach as a rich feedback channel to understand, model, and improve learning in mobile MOOC contexts. \n \nI first demonstrate AttentiveLearner, a mobile MOOC system which captures learners' physiological signals implicitly during learning on unmodified mobile phones. AttentiveLearner uses on-lens finger gestures for video control and monitors learners\u2019 photoplethysmography (PPG) signals based on the fingertip transparency change captured by the back camera. Through series of usability studies and follow-up analyses, I show that the tangible video control interface of AttentiveLearner is intuitive to use and easy to operate, and the PPG signals implicitly captured by AttentiveLearner can be used to infer both learners\u2019 cognitive states (boredom and confusion levels) and divided attention (multitasking and external auditory distractions). \n \nBuilding on top of AttentiveLearner, I design, implement, and evaluate a novel intervention technology, Context and Cognitive State triggered Feed-Forward (C2F2), which infers and responds to learners\u2019 boredom and disengagement events in real time via a combination of PPG-based cognitive state inference and learning topic importance monitoring. C2F2 proactively reminds a student of important upcoming content (feed-forward interventions) when disengagement is detected. A 48-participant user study shows that C2F2 on average improves learning gains by 20.2% compared with a non-interactive baseline system and is especially effective for bottom performers (improving their learning gains by 41.6%). \n \nFinally, to gain a holistic understanding of the dynamics of MOOC learning, I investigate the temporal dynamics of affective states of MOOC learners in a 22 participant study. Through both a quantitative analysis of the temporal transitions of affective states and a qualitative analysis of subjective feedback, I investigate differences between mobile MOOC learning and complex learning activities in terms of affect dynamics, and discuss pedagogical implications in detail.", "year": 2017}

User experience (UX) and Usage Continuance (UC) which latently signifying implementation success are vocal upon this mechanism. The advent of smart phones and mobile technologies such as Geographical Positioning System (GPS) has seen great proliferation in positioning outdoor location. However, GPS is incapable to work in an indoor environment (Hub, 2008) properly. Hence, for navigating indoor location one need to combine the existing mobile technologies and most of their components with location-based augmented reality. In this paper, implementation success of Indoor Navigation with Location-Based Augmented Reality named \u2018GuideMe\u201d is studied. The factors considered to evaluate implementation success are adopted from information systems and mobile computer interface literature. The objectives of this paper are to determine users\u2019 experience (satisfaction) and usage continuance of GuideMe. Prior to that, GuideMe has been successfully designed and developed using IOS with tools (Unity engine, Placenote SDK and XCode to set up IOS packages), User feedbacks are gathered via questionnaire forms taken from 35 respondents who volunteer to experiment GuideMe. The volunteers are free to choose and navigate offices at buildings of University of Jeddah (UJ), with the help of GuideMe. The findings of the study conclude that: GuideMe has facilitated users to navigate and seek indoor location independently, conveniently and efficiently since they did not disturb or asked others for directions. Hence, this has improved users\u2019 experience which indicates users\u2019 satisfaction. The high value of mean for \u201cbehavioral intention to use\u201d has shown users intend to continue using GuideMe.

Thesis (Doctorate) Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2018. People with severe motor disabilities may communicate using their eye movements aided by a virtual keyboard and an eye tracker. Text entry by gaze may also benefit users immersed in virtual or augmented realities, when they do not have access to a physical keyboard or touchscreen. Thus, both users with and without disabilities may take advantage of the ability to enter text by gaze. However, methods for text entry by gaze are typically slow and uncomfortable. In this thesis we propose EyeSwipe as a step further towards fast and comfortable text entry by gaze. EyeSwipe maps gaze paths into words, similarly to how finger traces are used on swipe-based methods for touchscreen devices. A gaze path differs from the finger trace in that it does not have clear start and end positions. To segment the gaze path from the user\u2019s continuous gaze data stream, EyeSwipe requires the user to explicitly indicate its beginning and end. The user can quickly glance at the vicinity of the other characters that compose the word. Candidate words are sorted based on the gaze path and presented to the user. We discuss two versions of EyeSwipe. EyeSwipe 1 uses a deterministic gaze gesture called Reverse Crossing to select both the first and last letters of the word. Considering the lessons learned during the development and test of EyeSwipe 1 we proposed EyeSwipe 2. The user emits commands to the interface by switching the focus between regions. In a text entry experiment comparing EyeSwipe 2 to EyeSwipe 1, 11 participants achieved an average text entry rate of 12.58 words per minute (wpm) with EyeSwipe 1 and 14.59 wpm with EyeSwipe 2 after using each method for 75 minutes. The maximum entry rates achieved with EyeSwipe 1 and EyeSwipe 2 were, respectively, 21.27 wpm and 32.96 wpm. Participants considered EyeSwipe 2 to be more comfortable and faster, while less accurate than EyeSwipe 1. Additionally, with EyeSwipe 2 we proposed the use of gaze path data to dynamically adjust the gaze estimation. Using data from the experiment we show that gaze paths can be used to dynamically improve gaze estimation during the interaction.", "year": 2018}

Through internal organizational systems, sales companies find a way to treat their strategic customers differently from traditional customers. Key customer management is no longer seen as a simple process of interaction that takes place between the buyer and the seller. The key customer is the backbone of all active actions through technological innovations and the application of modern marketing techniques in order to meet the constant growth of consumer demand / service users. Through the integration of sales and marketing skills, a special added value is created for the strategic customer, created in the atmosphere and shopping experience that is usually shaped individually. The article deals with the competencies and techniques by which the sales and marketing sectors channel their communication to the most important clients. From nurturing competitive intelligence, emotional competence, empathy and active empathic listening, self-control activities, communication and presentation skills, interculutral communication, negotiation skills, adaptive sales, consultative sales, coordination skills, customer knowledge, products and technical management, performance orientation and sales efficiency, ethical behavior, sales experience to the resolvement of possible conflicts. From a theoretical point of view, the article points out the importance of synergistic action of sales and integrated marketing activities, both for traditional and online customers. From a managerial point of view, the article significantly provides determinants to sales MPs on how to define, recruit and nurture key customers in their business. This article also offers potential answers that create a turbulent market environment versus sales structures - it examines how marketing techniques meet the requirements of modern strategic customers, but also vice versa, as technologically modern products require the transformation of communication to important consumers. The role of sales and marketing managers is extremely important in creating an interactive relationship with key customers. Evaluating the company's vision and mission, as well as the most important set goals make it easier to find the target key customers. Thanks to new digital marketing technologies, the boundaries of cooperation with important customers are constantly expanding, and this further adds importance to online market research, new appearances and design of the offer in accordance with the requests of the target customer population.

Since the introduction of the multi-slice CT scanners, a continuous process of technological evolution has made possible a new range of diagnostic applications. These scanners allowed to obtain more anatomical information using advanced dose reduction techniques and to acquire with high resolution in order to improve image quality and reduce artefacts.\nBut the continuous increase of the number of patients undergoing CT explorations and the impact of clinical applications have implied an exponential increase of the doses due to CT examinations in medicine. This is particularly relevant in some newest explorations that involve high doses, such as CT perfusion (CTP), CT angiography (CTA), dynamic scans (4D CT) and others.\nAdditionally, the introduction of new CT equipment has introduced several technical advances in recent years, such as a 320 detector-row CT scanner (Aquilion ONE) for cone-beam acquisitions with a volume coverage of 160 mm in a single 0.35 s full rotation. These features lead to a reduction of the scan time and a minimization of the movement artefacts.\nWith the appearance of the 320 detector-row CT scanners, the existing CT dose metrics had to be revised and new approaches for Computed Tomography dose index (CTDI) dosimetry for cone-beam scanners were suggested. In parallel, some specific CT explorations and acquisitions have been adapted to this scanner since its coverage allowed for imaging of whole organs in a single axial rotation.\nAccording to ALARA principle, radiation doses to patients have to be As Low As Reasonably Achievable. Hence, considering the fast technical advances in x-ray imaging during last years and the increase in the amount of CT examinations, there is a need to be aware about radiation exposure in current acquisition protocols in order to optimize the clinical application of CT and to minimize possible radiation-induced health effects.\nThere are different methods to estimate doses such as dosimetric studies in anthropomorphic phantoms, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation studies or k-factors that convert the dose-length product (DLP) to effective dose. Besides, several dosimetric software tools have been developed to facilitate the determination of the effective dose and the organ doses from MC data sets.\nMC code simulates the radiation transport through voxelized space taking into account the geometry and x-ray characteristics of the CT scanner and compute the energy deposition from interactions of the beam in each voxel of the irradiated phantom. Hence, this method provides a versatile and accurate tool to estimate organ doses and effective dose in CT examinations. Regarding the literature, several studies about dose assessment in CT using MC simulation-based methods have been published. However, most are based on CT scanners with narrow collimation geometries and mathematical phantoms, becoming outdated with the publication of the latest recommendation from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) such as the adult computational phantoms and the commercialization of the new CT contemporary scanners.\nFor this reason, there is a need to develop methods for patient doses assessment in CT examinations that are up to date with current scanner technology and design, current acquisition protocols and the latest reference in computational phantoms.\nMotivation and objectives\nThe motivation of this thesis was the development of a MC simulation tool taking into account all relevant technical characteristics of the 320 detector-row cone-beam CT scanner and the latest recommendations of the ICRP with the aim of assessing doses in patients undergoing CT examinations. In this framework, the starting hypothesis of this project is that the use of methods based on MC simulation using the ICRP adult computational phantoms can be a useful tool to estimate patient doses undergoing examinations with a 320 detector-row cone-beam CT scanner.\nThe main specific objectives of this thesis are:\n1. To devise a MC simulation tool for dose assessment that accurately reproduces the 320 detector-row cone-beam CT scanner operation taking into account all parameters that influence dose.\n2. To validate the MC program by comparing results from simulations with the actual dose measurements in the scanner.\n3. To apply the MC simulation program to assess doses using the ICRP adult computational phantoms. In particular, to calculate organ doses and effective doses of four clinical acquisition CT protocols used in the scanner with and without automatic tube current modulation (TCM).\n4. To apply the MC simulation program to assess doses for the cardiac CT protocol performed in a international multicenter study (CORE320) which includes CT calcium scoring, CT coronary angiography and CT myocardial perfusion using the 320 detector-row scanner and the ICRP adult computational phantoms. To study the influence of the positioning of the patient during the cardiac CT scan.\n5. To apply the MC simulation program to estimate the patient dose from perfusion CT examinations of the brain, lung tumors and the liver on a 320 detector-row scanner with the ICRP adult computational phantoms.\n6. To determine the conversion factors (k-factors) to estimate effective dose from DLP for each CT protocol.\n7. To develop a software based on MC simulation to easily assess and report doses for standard patients undergoing CT examinations in a 320 detector-row cone-beam scanner.\n Results\nThis thesis is compounded from four papers. They described the procedure followed to tailor the scanner model in a MC simulation program, the validation of the MC code, the use of the program for dose estimation in different CT examinations and the development of the dosimetric software tool for dose assessment and reporting.\nPaper I was focused on the modelling and validation of a MC simulation program for patient dose assessment for a 320 detector-row CT scanner. All the technical features of the scanner were successfully reproduced. The MC program was validated by comparing simulations results with actual dose measurements acquired under the same conditions. Once validated, patient dose assessment was performed for four clinical axial acquisitions using the ICRP adult reference phantoms. The results were nearly always lower than those obtained from other dose calculator tools or published in other studies, which were obtained using mathematical phantoms in different CT systems. The influence on dose of TCM in one of the acquisitions was also analysed, leading to dose decrease and greater uniformity of the dose distributions.\nThe MC simulation program was used in Paper II and Paper III in order to estimate organ absorbed dose and effective dose in standard patients for specific CT acquisition protocols. The former evaluated doses from a cardiac CT protocol, including CT calcium scoring, CT coronary angiography and CT myocardial perfusion with a 320 detector-row volumetric CT scanner according to the internationally recognized recommendations of the ICRP. The effect on patient dose of off-centering the patient and the positioning of the arms were evaluated. The latter was focused on perfusion CT examinations. The MC simulation tool was used to calculate the organ doses and the effective dose in the adult reference computational phantoms undergoing CTP Brain, CTP Lung Tumour and CTP Liver studies. Additionally dose assessment was performed for the skin and the eye lens. These CTP protocols performed in a 320 detector-row CT scanner operate safely below threshold doses for deterministic effects. Conversion factors (k-factors) were obtained to estimate effective doses from DLP in both cardiac and perfusion CT protocols. Results showed that in many studies the dose assessment for cardiac and body perfusion acquisitions is performed with a k-factor that underestimates effective doses. Contrarily, dose is overestimated in head examinations.\nFinally, the development of a software dosimetric tool for accurate dose assessment in CT with the 320 detector-row cone-beam scanner was described in Paper IV. The software, called SimDoseCT, was based on look-up tables generated from MC simulation. By selecting the appropriate acquisition technique through a graphical user interface, the software reports organ absorbed doses and effective doses from all possible acquisitions within the CT scanner, like axial (volumetric), helical and scanogram acquisitions. The validation and testing of the software demonstrated the accurate methodology of SimDoseCT and its usefulness for dose assessment in CT.\n Conclusions\nThis dissertation presents a framework for dose estimates in standard patients undergoing CT examinations with a 320 detector-row cone-beam scanner. A set of k-factors and also a software dosimetric tool for an accurate estimation of organ absorbed doses and effective doses were created with the aim of improving the easily dose evaluation for standard adult patients in CT contemporary scanners. The initial intended goals of the study were covered with the methodology and results described in the four papers that constituted this thesis. Future research could be focused on technical extensions in the dosimetric software such as the implementation of the TCM, size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) or paediatric patients. In addition, new studies combining dosimetry with image quality evaluation could be perform for the optimization in CT latest technologies.", "year": 2017}

The system is divided into three parts: sensing module, safety control module and equipment monitoring module. The hardware and software are designed according to the structure of the system. The hardware is mainly analyzed according to the two modules of image recognition and speech recognition. The software part is to use pyroelectric infrared and vibration sensors to sense anti-theft information and improve anti-theft monitoring.

The security monitoring performance of this system is relatively high. This article will explore the design of this security monitoring. With the development of Internet of Things (IOT) technology and big data, people have put forward higher standards for security issues in family environment. Because the housing safety problems mainly include household appliances, gas operation accidents and abnormal room operation. Therefore, it is necessary to keep abreast of the situation at home when you go out. Traditional safety measures can no longer be handled. With the help of Internet +, sensors, IoT and big data technology. Home security information can be sent to the user's mobile phone or network in time so that the homeowner can control it in real time. The ability to intelligently monitor it is the subject of modern home security research. This article will explore this topic. 1. Design background of smart home security monitoring With the improvement of living standards, new requirements have been put forward to the living environment. The safety device with a single alarm function no longer meets the needs of people. Home security monitoring system smart home should complete home security monitoring and alarm, it is based on the Internet of Things smart home security monitoring system architecture. Smart home security monitoring system includes sensor module, safety control module and equipment monitoring module, the main purpose is to achieve family security.

Composition and Structure of Monitoring System According to the structure of smart home security monitoring system, the system hardware is designed. The hardware module mainly includes image recognition module, gateway processor, 2019 4th International Workshop on Materials Engineering and Computer Sciences (IWMECS 2019) Copyright \u00a9 (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/iwmecs.2019.053 269 speech recognition module, sensor and single chip computer. Among them, the gateway processor installed in the system is an optimized external memory interface based on ARM1176 architecture. The image recognition module is mainly used for access control, including camera, sensor and recognition device. Network junction and processing chip, mainly identifies fingerprints and face images [1]. The image recognition function structure can prevent the interference of the sensing channel and compare the processing result with the template information to obtain the recognition result. The camera and sensor collect facial and fingerprint images, and the collected information is sent to the image processing chip through the network interface. The chip automatically analyzes and responds to the image information, and finally the recognition result is displayed by the device. The image processing chip has built-in AE/AWB function and can convert various data formats. A feature recognition unit and an image information extraction unit are built in the chip, and have excellent image recognition functions. The voice recognition function is also one of the important functions of the security monitoring of the smart home, and the voice signal is collected by the sound collector. The A/D is converted into a digital signal, the encoder is used to encode and decode the digital signal, and the Codec result is input to the buffer. Storage If voice recognition is interrupted or voice needs to be played, the system will wake up the interrupt server and automatically determine whether to play or reconfirm. If voice is required, the coded data is converted to D/A and sent to the playback terminal. 3. Hardware Design of Monitoring System As a 32-bit processor monitoring system, STM32F103 is chosen as CPU. The system has a maximum operating frequency of 72 MHz, fast data processing and huge information resources. External interrupt source handles multiple interrupts at the same time, improves the utilization of processor resources, provides three channels of I2C, SPI and other multi-channel communication interfaces, and extends Flash and SDRAM for Nor. The microprocessor is connected to expand the storage data space and has high data transmission for the DAM channel [2]. The STM32 chip exchanges data with the wireless communication module and other sensor unit modules through the interface. High performance, low cost and low power consumption compared to other microcontrollers. The data transmission of the system is realized by the wireless bridge, and the data collected by the home is transmitted to the user mobile terminal via the wireless network, thereby improving the efficiency and coordination of the communication. The main research in circuit configuration is the data exchange between the STM32 microcontroller and the W5500, as well as the data reception, processing and transmission between the wireless sensor module and the sensor. The main controller establishes network connection with W5500 module and communicates with the main controller chip through SPI serial external interface. Send the data to the Internet of Things platform, and finally exchange information with the user terminal. The NRF2410 module of 2.4 GHz radio transceiver is connected to various sensors to collect the changes of sensor data in real time and send the data to the main controller. 4. Software Design of Monitoring System The intelligent community security system based on Internet of Things technology should be designed scientifically and reasonably according to the principles of accuracy, stability, timeliness and easy interaction [3]. It is the lowest layer of the system, that is, sensor node layer. It uses WIFI access network to collect, sense and transmit environmental information around and inside the community. Then, the network layer is responsible for receiving and sending information, and is the communication layer linking to the underlying devices. This is followed by the business layer. This layer decompresses the data packet using the protocol conversion module and uses the data processing module to preprocess and display the data information. Finally, the application layer [4]. This layer provides real-time visual management of intelligent community security monitoring data, reflecting the characteristics of intuitive and convenient.", "year": 2019}

However, current haptic devices, such as Geomagic Touch, fail to provide immersive and natural haptic interaction in virtual surgery due to the inherent mechanical friction, inertia, limited workspace and flawed haptic feedback. To tackle this issue, we design a novel magnetic levitation haptic device based on electromagnetic principles to augment the tissue stiffness perception in virtual environment. Users can naturally interact with the virtual tissue by tracking the motion of magnetic stylus using stereoscopic vision so that they can accurately sense the stiffness by the magnetic stylus, which moves in the magnetic field generated by our device. We propose the idea that the effective magnetic field (EMF) is closely related to the coil attitude for the first time. To fully harness the magnetic field and flexibly generate the specific magnetic field for obtaining required haptic perception, we adopt probability clouds to describe the requirement of interactive applications and put forward an algorithm to calculate the best coil attitude. Moreover, we design a control interface circuit and present a self-adaptive fuzzy proportion integration differentiation (PID) algorithm to precisely control the coil current. We evaluate our haptic device via a series of quantitative experiments which show the high consistency of the experimental and simulated magnetic flux density, the high accuracy (0.28 mm) of real-time 3D positioning and tracking of the magnetic stylus, the low power consumption of the adjustable coil configuration, and the tissue stiffness perception accuracy improvement by 2.38 percent with the self-adaptive fuzzy PID algorithm. We conduct a user study with 22 participants, and the results suggest most of the users can clearly and immersively perceive different tissue stiffness and easily detect the tissue abnormality. Experimental results demonstrate that our magnetic levitation haptic device can provide accurate tissue stiffness perception augmentation with natural and immersive haptic interaction.", "year": 2018}

The paper has a multi/interdisciplinary character, calling for e-learning, telecommunication, database, programming, IT applications and social/business networks.\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) refers to those data analysis systems by integrating them into a platform that allows the association of information through data transformation operations. For this analysis to be effective, it is necessary to identify and define the required quality indicators (KPIs: Key Performance Indicators) and the desired associations with them, which can be made in the BI platform. The information extraction operations can be done in the SQL queries area or when data is uploaded to the BI platform, taking into account the following factors: database queries efficiency, transformation efficiency at BI platform level, and available hardware capacity for calculations.\nThere is a balance between the volume of SQL queries, taking into account the complexity of the queries (number and type of joins) and the size of the files to be imported into the platform. Consideration may also be given to how new data is added to source files for the BI platform.\nThe applications developed for this purpose allow the analysis of KPIs by applying filters that make easier to understand the general problems of an application and identify network areas where possible degradation or shortcomings are observed.\nDeveloping a solution for analyzing these aspects of radio measurements and comparing operators on various criteria for voice and data and application testing comes as a response to the need to be able to analyze and interpret a huge amount of data accumulated over very long periods (years) and to identify the main elements that can lead to improved network performance.\nBI analysis is addressed to business managerial levels for discovery of large deficiencies without analyzing each test, satisfying the need for interaction by allocating a minimum number of parameters associated with KPIs so that analysis and decisions taken consequently have a high impact for a company benefits.\nBI analysis is predominantly conducted in the telecommunications field, but the same principles can be used in other areas, and the way of working can be adapted to serve as a strong starting point in any type of analysis for which information is available at the level of a database.\nIn order to be able to apply the BI analysis tools, databases containing information specific to the 2G, 3G and 4G technologies (GSM, WCDMA and LTE) have been developed. Databases contain tables populated with metrics representing information similar to those collected during telecommunication measurements (data generation is done through popular spreadsheet scripts with Excel support). Multiple SQL queries for denormalizing, aggregating, and transforming data have also been developed for use as a data source in the KPIs analysis, comparison, and interpretation process.\nIn order to apply these data transformation queries in a format that facilitates further BI analysis, a C# application that exports the new content to a predefined area is made available to the BI environment (in text format).\nThe new C# content is loaded into the QLIK Sense Desktop platform, a BI development environment where another set of data transformations, (defining legends to create geo-location features for elements) is loaded in this environment. The next step is to develop specific formulas, taking into account the new available structure to obtain KPIs with expected values and views for post-denormalization analysis. Two dashboards were developed for this purpose: voice and data tests.\nConfiguring the development environment involves setting the connection to the location where the new content is placed, uploading these data, modifying them, creating formulas, identifying causes of value-based telecoms errors, creating a range for radio measurement values, and creating functions for geo-location of data using QLIK script syntax.\nIt is defined a graphical interface by creating, where necessary, maps of geo-tagged data, filters, graphs, pivot tables, pie-charts, histograms, etc. across multiple display sheets, organized to contain the information specific to a particular analysis, thereby creating an analytical context in which the information required for use in the analysis is arranged adjacent, in the form of filters or graphs, the results being easier to interpret by introducing color coding formulas.\nThe definition of special formulas and their application uses KPIs, and their development is carried out with a language specific to the development environment: QLIK Sense Desktop.\nPart of analyzing data in a BI environment is to interpret data and various configurations. Depending on who accesses such an environment, one can configure (in the web version) different access modes and set up visible information for each user so that a manager can access general performance sheets and an RF engineer can access specific performance sheets, both of which being designed to enhance the ability of each to interpret, decide, and improve the desired performance.\nAnother important aspect is the low analysis time, due to the fact that the data automatically undergoes a transformation that initially had to be manually adapted. Automatic correlations that may go unnoticed, and there is also the ability to adapt and change over time. Increased efficiency comes from the fact that uncorrelated information in the database becomes correlated.\nBI applications refresh after each selected criterion so that the same graph shows different information if a single operator/service is selected. The paper contains detailed BI complex analysis examples for the video player in social networks: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.\nIn the BI environment, possible causes for the effects observed in the operations are performed, resulting in an easier interpretation of the results. This information can be valuable to departments such as Marketing/Sales, Network Operations Center, Optimization/Planning, etc.\nData analysis by using a BI platform is useful when data sources are not directly correlated, allowing optimized visualization and identification of KPIs performance and metrics specifically defined for fast and efficient handling of data specific to mobile telecom operators and social networks or business networks.", "year": 2019}

Smartphones are no longer simple communication tools. They integrate entertainment, business, communication and other functions into one, and become an important electronic tool in people's lives. As an important application of smart phones, mobile games have increased in number of users year by year. In order to occupy a strong market, mobile games should not only highlight the integration, humanization, challenge, fun, and optimization of mobile phone interfaces. As a mobile phone interface for players to interact with mobile games, the rationality of its design directly affects the user experience and user evaluation of the player. Therefore, the design of the mobile game interface should be easy to learn, easy to use, conform to user operating habits, interactive, and secure. The article mainly discusses the optimization scheme of human-machine interface in mobile game design. 1. The Mobile Game Interface Overview Mobile game refers to the game software that uses mobile phone software as the information carrier and runs on the mobile phone, that is, the game program that can be run on the mobile phone. Mobile games are divided into stand-alone games and online games. Single-player games can be run independently only through the mobile phone client without using other network media. Online games use the Internet as a medium to connect the game operator server and the client. Complete a sustainable, individual, multiplayer online game. With the continuous development of smart phones, the functions of mobile phones are becoming more and more perfect, and the development of the mobile game industry has also ushered in an unprecedented opportunity [1]. The human-machine interface, that is, the user-used interface, is a dialogue interface between the person and the intelligent terminal for information transmission and exchange, and is a window for realizing information conversion between the system and the user. All areas involved in the exchange of human-machine information need to involve human-machine interface. All information exchange and control activities of human and intelligent terminals are completed through human-machine interface [2]. The good man-machine concept is simple, easy to understand, practical and easy to index, ensuring a good user experience and improving user efficiency. Interaction design is a discipline involving many fields, and interaction design is an artistic display. At this stage, the types of mobile games are becoming more and more abundant. The interactive design is an important measure to improve the entertainment of mobile games and meet the entertainment needs of mobile users. It can be seen that the ultimate goal of interaction design is to improve the performance of the product, to make the user feel emotionally pleasing, and to highlight the important value of the design product. 2. Mobile Game User Interface Design Principles The mobile game user interface is different from the ordinary PC-side interface. In the design process of the mobile game interface, attention should be paid to the characteristics of the mobile game user interface: on the one hand, the design of the mobile game user interface should ensure the uniformity between the interfaces. Try to maintain a uniform style between different interfaces in the same mobile game. Style-integrated interface design elements include color, shape, overall 2018 International Conference on Data Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Communications (DPAIC 2018) Copyright \u00a9 (2018) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/dpaic.2018.040 181 structure, common window styles, fonts, and more. And the unified interface style can minimize the game capacity, the picture resources can be reused, and the program design can also achieve uniform visual effects by applying code. On the other hand, we must deal with the relationship between game interface design and model porting. Many games need to be transplanted between different models of mobile phones. The screen size is different and the impact on the game interface is relatively large [3]. Therefore, to deal with the relationship between game interface design and model migration, you can scale according to the length and width of the screen. , adjust the phone interface. Therefore, the interface design of mobile games should follow the following principles: The so-called interactive freedom principle means that the game designer should provide accurate and concise game information for the user, and guide the user to play the game more smoothly. The game interface design must ensure that the game information should be instructive, so that the user can immerse through the visual and auditory experience. In the joy of the game, the whole process emphasizes the freedom of mobile phone users, making them feel the game in all directions, enhancing their game experience and highlighting the entertainment of the game. The essence of mobile games is entertainment, so in the interface design, not only to ensure the convenience of operation, but also to ensure the fun of the game. Before designing, it is necessary to understand the user's age, gender, psychological characteristics, etc., and accurately locate the customer base. For example, male and female users have different choices of game types. Therefore, the interface design should conduct comprehensive research and analysis, and the mobile game will be the entertainment features are fully utilized. Mobile games take up more time for users to fragment, so the game operation design should follow the principle of \u201ceasy to use, difficult to master\u201d. The hardware interface allows users to quickly enter the game characters through buttons, touch screens or other types of input methods, in the shortest engage users into the game during the time [4]. 3. The Optimization Design of Human-Machine Interface in Mobile Games Specifically, the optimal design of the human-machine interface in mobile games can be carried out from the following aspects: The visual interface content of mobile games includes text, graphics, animation, etc. These elements form different interfaces with uniform styles. However, the mobile phone interface is limited by the size of the screen, so the amount of information that can be provided to the user in the game interface is also limited. The range of people's vision is limited. Therefore, in the design of mobile game interface, it is necessary to avoid arranging large paragraphs of text, pictures and animations in the same interface, and try to design a simple visual and intuitive game interface to improve the user's game experience [5]. Eliminate the irritability caused by visual screening pressure and improve the interaction between users and games. For example, the \"Glory of the King\" with a very large user volume uses a neatly arranged \"square\" module, and uses a combination of pictures and text to introduce the game function, especially the function of the function module in the edge area, which allows the user to A quick understanding of the game's features. When a user first comes into contact with a mobile game, whether it can master the function of the game in a short time will have a decisive influence on the continuity of its subsequent use, and the short-term memory of the person is very limited and unstable, so the mobile game The interface design must fully consider the limits of the human brain processing information, try to make users familiar with the function of the product without consulting the manual, and can operate correctly to improve the user's loyalty to the game. For example, the \u201cGlory of the King\u201d is used as an example. The function introduction adopts the combination of picture and text. The game interface adopts the disc-style operation lever, so that the primary users can also quickly master the operation essentials. In short, the excellent human-computer interaction interface can directly and intuitively convey the interface information to the user, which is more consistent with the user's cognitive habits, and can guide the user to enter the game operation mode quickly and intuitively; appropriate prompts, graphic metaphors, Designs such as hidden help can provide users with more and more meaningful information, improve user comfort and convenience during the game [6].", "year": 2019}

Remote laboratories use real physical laboratories which are capable of being accessed through a network. The instruments can be accessed, monitored and controlled at distance. In comparison, virtual laboratories are basically simulations which mimic the behaviors of real laboratory artifacts. The results of the virtual experimentation process should be similar to those obtained in a real laboratory, but results are mostly based on calculations and mathematical formulas. Most advanced virtual laboratories include in the data processing information of previous experiments made in real laboratories to create a more realistic and reliable environment that considers behavior of real components. Development of remote laboratories in academic settings has been held back because of the lack of standardization of technology, processes, operation and their integration with formal educational environments. Remote laboratories are used in educational settings for a variety of reasons, for instance, when the equipment is not available in the physical laboratory; when the physical laboratory space available is not sufficient to either set up the experiments or permit access to all on-site students in the course; or when the teacher needs to provide online laboratory experiences to students taking courses via distance education. Centers around the world have been developing platforms that grant remote access to a collection of physical experiments that provide alternatives to educational institutions to reduce budgets of not only equipment purchases but also other expenses, such as, people, space, maintenance, and electricity consumption. This thesis proposes a new approach for the development and deployment of online laboratories over online platforms. The research activities include: The design of an architecture of a system for Smart Adaptive Remote Laboratories (SARL) integrated to educational environments to improve the remote laboratory users experience through the implementation of a modular architecture and the use of context information about the users and laboratory activities; the definition of a design pattern for Remote Laboratory Management System (RLMS); the definition of Smart Laboratory Learning Object (SLLO) capable of being integrated in different educational environments; the definition of a reliability model to detect and report failures and possible causes and countermeasures applying ruled based systems; a prototype implementation of the architecture and remote labs demos that have been used as a proof-of-concept by the IEEE P1876 Networked Smart Learning Objects for Online Laboratories Standard and the Actionable Data Book (ADB) presented at the 2017 Frankfurt book fair in Germany.

The population in this study is companies with manufacturing types listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in the period 2013 to 2017. Samples were obtained using a purposive random sampling method. Data analysis uses fixed effects. The results showed that the capital structure, profitability and size of the company affect earnings management INTRODUCTION The development of the state of the economy in Indonesia is still not stable in line with the presidential election event, so the manufacturing industry market is currently experiencing a decline from the previous year. According to Arif (2016), influencing factors are due to a decrease in demand in key markets, increasing global trade tensions and the need to stay at the forefront of future technology. The manufacturing industry has become one of the important sectors in the development of a fairly stable national economy and is supporting the economy with a positive growth rate. With the current challenges, both internal and external challenges, the government needs to implement several strategies. These strategies are focused on how to create a manufacturing industry that is resilient to crisis shocks and industrial conditions or climate that can attract investors. The phenomenon that often occurs in relation to earnings management usually arises due to a form of error and negligence of the subject of financial management itself, which is directly or indirectly influenced by various factors, both internal and external (Mahawyahrti and Budiasih, 2016). Mahawyahrti and Budiasih, (2016) said that if a condition in which the management did not succeed in achieving the specified profit target, then management would utilize the flexibility allowed by accounting standards in preparing financial statements to modify reported earnings. Management will be motivated to show good performance in producing maximum value or profit for the company so that management tends to choose and apply accounting methods that can provide better earnings information. The interesting to be traced is management behavior in carrying out earnings management practices. The importance of profit information for its users makes each company competing to increase its profits. But for certain parties there are doing unhealthy ways to achieve individual goals of company profit information. This is usually used as a practice of profit manipulation carried out by company management who know the conditions in the company (Dinda Dwi, 2019). Management behavior that regulates earnings as above is usually known as earnings management. Earning management initially appears and is done by the compilers of financial statements in a company's financial reporting process because they expect a benefit from these actions (Mahawyahrti and Budiasih, 2016). Earnings management is one of the conditions where management intervenes in the process of preparing financial statements for external parties so that they can flatten, increase and decrease profits (Fathiani, 2016). If the company's earnings management is correct and in accordance with existing regulations, earnings management can be efficient, meaning that it can increase the informativeness of earnings in SJIF Impact Factor: 7.001| ISI I.F.Value:1.241| Journal DOI: 10.36713/epra2016 ISSN: 2455-7838(Online) EPRA International Journal of Research and Development (IJRD) Volume: 5 | Issue: 5 | May 2020 Peer Reviewed Journal 2020 EPRA IJRD | Journal DOI: https://doi.org/10.36713/epra2016 | www.eprajournals.com |75 | communicating personal information. However, if earnings management is not done in the right way then it can be opportunistic, meaning that earnings management reports its profits opportunistically to maximize its personal interests (Scott in Hartanto, 2011). Although some writers interpret earnings management in different languages, but thus have the same meaning of determining earnings in such a way by playing with the numbers in the financial statements of a company not based on the actual situation by obtaining expected profits. Problem Identification 1. Does the capital structure affect earnings management? 2. Does profitability affect earnings management? 3. Does the size of the company affect earnings management? LITERATUR REVIEW Capital Structure According to Hery (2015) capital structure is the ratio or balance of long-term funding of the company which is shown by the ratio of long-term debt to equity. Meanwhile, according to Fahmi (2015) capital structure is a balance between the use of loan capital consisting of short-term debt that is permanent, long-term debt with own capital consisting of preferred shares and ordinary shares. Furthermore, according to Mulyawan (2015), the company's capital structure is a mixture or proportion of long-term debt and equity, in order to fund its investments (operating assets). Based on some of these references, the author can conclude that capital structure is an important issue for the company because of the good or bad capital structure will have a direct effect on the financial position of the company, especially with the existence of a very large debt will burden the company (Hirdinis,2019). Profitability Profitability according to Harahap (2015) is describing the ability of a company to get profits through all capabilities and existing resources such as sales, cash, capital, number of employees, number of branches of a company, and so forth. Meanwhile, according to Brigham and Houston (2009), profitability is the final result of a number of policies and decisions made by the company. Based on the opinions of the experts above, the conclusion can be drawn is the company's ability to generate profits by using existing resources within the company itself. Profitability ratios according to Weston and Copeland (2010) are measuring the effectiveness of management based on the results of returns generated from sales and investments. Profitability ratio according to Kasmir (2016) is a ratio to measure how much the level of profit that can be obtained by the company. Based on the above theory it can be concluded that the profitability ratio is a ratio to measure how much a company is able to generate profits by using all the factors that the company is in to produce maximum profit. Firm Size According to Riyanto (2013) firm size is amount of equity, sales or asset values. According to Torang (2012), firm size is the size of the organization is a context variable that measures the demands of the service or product of the organization. Furthermore, according to Kasmir (2016) firm size is a scale where the size of the company can be classified according to various ways, including the size of income, total assets, and total capital. The greater the size of revenue, total assets, and total capital will reflect the company's condition that is getting stronger. Based on some of the above understanding, it can be seen that the size of the company is a scale that describes the size of the company with various values such as equity, sales, and company assets, the greater the value reflects a stronger company. Earning Management According to Scott (2012), opinion that earnings management is earning management intervention in the process of preparing financial statements for external parties so that they can flatten, increase, and decrease earnings reporting, where management can use the leeway of using accounting methods, making policies (discreationary) which can accelerate or delay costs and revenues, so that the company's profits are smaller or larger as expected. According to Kieso (2011) earnings management is defined as the time planning of revenues, expenses, gains and losses to flatten earnings fluctuations. Past Research And Framework There is a gap research regarding the effect of Capital Structure, Profitability and Company Size on Profit Management. Research conducted by Agustia and Elly (2018) and Indracahya and Dewi (2017) shows that the capital structure has a positive and significant effect on earnings management. The results of this study contradict the research conducted by Minabari, et al (2017) and Widianingrum and Sunarto (2017) that the Capital Structure has no significant effect on earnings management. Research conducted by Agustia and Elly (2018) shows that profitability has no significant effect on earnings management. This is contrary to research conducted by Tata and Herman (2017) which shows that profitability has a positive and significant effect on earnings management. Research conducted by Ali (2015) and Medyawati and Astri (2016) shows that company size has a positive and significant effect on earnings management. This contrasts with research conducted SJIF Impact Factor: 7.001| ISI I.F.Value:1.241| Journal DOI: 10.36713/epra2016 ISSN: 2455-7838(Online) EPRA International Journal of Research and Development (IJRD) Volume: 5 | Issue: 5 | May 2020 Peer Reviewed Journal 2020 EPRA IJRD | Journal DOI: https://doi.org/10.36713/epra2016 | www.eprajournals.com |76 | by Kingsley, et al (2016) and Widianingrum and Sunarto (2018) which shows that company size has no significant effect on earnings management.

It explores the experience of a niche search firm whose founder attributed her ability to open her recruiting firm to LinkedIn and the new model of recruiting it created. LinkedIn Corporation had been one of the most successful companies in the digital media space, with more than 4,000 employees and a market capitalization of over $25.5 billion in August 2013. But few people knew how LinkedIn had grown and how it had become profitable. LinkedIn had multiple unique aspects to explore: its focus on professional--not simply personal--social interaction, the company's B2B components, and also its marketing positioning from user experience to targeting and growth strategy. \nExcerpt \nUVA-M-0858 \nRev. Feb. 18, 2015 \nPLBsearch: Growing with LinkedIn \nFriday, August 2, 2012, was a hot summer afternoon in Washington, DC. Pepper Lunsford Binner updated her LinkedIn profile before clearing out the office for a beach vacation. She indicated that her employment as a recruiter at Korn/Ferry International had ended. She entered the name of her new firm: PLBsearch. By Saturday morning, she had four clients. She hadn't even bought her own laptop yet. (See Exhibit 1 for sample messages.) \nBefore leaving her previous employer to open her own shop, Binner had prepared several things. She had budgeted for a drop in household income; she had planned for office space and the administrative needs of her own firm; she had also established a corporate identity and paid a marketing company $ 900 to prepare an announcement e-mail that she would send to her contacts when she and her family returned from vacation. She never sent the announcement e-mail. By simply updating her own employment status on LinkedIn, Binner had more clients than she was ready to take on. She remembered, \u201cI was building this ship and flying it at the same time.\u201d And Binner attributed her ability to open her own boutique recruiting firm to the very tool she used to announce her firm's founding. LinkedIn had transformed the recruiting process for everyone in the industry. \nAlthough Binner was a recruiter, she didn't take advantage of all of the features LinkedIn had designed for search firms. Even after operating her business for a full year, she still hadn't purchased LinkedIn's premium online tools. She had started a niche firm\u2014and, at least so far, LinkedIn was serving her niche very affordably. The sales team contacted Binner at least once every quarter to upsell her, but wasn't having success. \n. . .", "year": 2017}

Detailed Description In a networked environment, such as the Internet or other networks, first-party content providers can provide information for public presentation on resources, for example webpages, documents, applications, and/or other resources, such as website publishers or other publishers of first-party content. The first-party content can include text, video, and/or audio information provided by the first-party content providers via, for example, a resource server for presentation on a client device over the Internet. The first-party content may be a webpage requested by the client device or a stand-alone application (e.g., a video game, a chat program, etc.) running on the client device. Additional third-party content, such as an advertisement, can also be provided by third-party content providers, such as an advertiser, for presentation on the client device together with the first-party content provided by the firstparty content providers. For example, the third-party content may be a public service announcement or advertisement that appears in conjunction with a requested resource, such as a webpage (e.g., a search result webpage from a search engine, a webpage that includes an online article, a webpage of a social networking service, etc.) or with an application (e.g., an advertisement within a game). Thus, a person viewing a resource can access the first-party 2 Burriesci et al.: DETECTION OF POSITION FIXED CONTENT ITEM SLOTS AND CONTROL OF CON Published by Technical Disclosure Commons, 2016 Error! Unknown document property name. content that is the subject of the resource as well as the third-party content that may or may not be related to the subject matter of the resource. In some instances, a publisher of the first-party content may include third-party content that maintains a fixed position and/or moves at a different rate than the first-party content. Such third-party content items may be called floating third-party content, position fixed third-party content, anchor third-party content, etc. While these third-party content items can provide improved performance, the third-party content items may also result in increased accidental clicks, taps, or other interactions due to the increased time on screen and/or the fixed placement of the third-party content, such as near a side or bottom edge of the viewable content. Such interactions accidental interactions can lower the average value for a third-party content provider relative to interactions intending to select the third-party content item and/or third-party content items provided in a fixed slot. The lowering of the average value can result in a decrease in network value and/or sales. In some implementations, the first-party content may include a portion of code with a third-party content item request script that detects whether a content item slot is a position fixed content item slot and/or scrolls at a different rate than the rest of the content of the resource. To do so, the portion of code traverses up the content item slot container element hierarchy to examine each parent container element to determine whether the parent container element is position \u201cfixed\u201d relative to the first-party content. A content item request URL parameter, pfx, is added to the content item request URL, and will have a value of 1 if any of the parent container elements is position fixed or will have a value of 0 if no parent container is position fixed. If the ad slot is position fixed and/or scrolls at a different rate than the rest of the content of the resource, then the content item serving system can use the information in a 3 Defensive Publications Series, Art. 173 [2016] http://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/173 Error!

In some implementations, where the position fixed parameter has a value of 1, indicating that the content item slot is position-fixed, then click protections can be automatically enabled to prevent low intentioned, accidental, or misled clicks. For instance, the click protections may include a feature for confirmation of a click through a user interface or a delay in post page load before the displayed content item can be clicked. In some implementations, where the position fixed parameter has a value of 1, the parameter can be passed to an auction so that interactions with position fixed content items can be priced differently than other content item interactions. For example, such fixed position content item slots can be priced lower that normal content item slots to account for accidental clicks if a content item is selected for the content item slot on a cost per click basis. However, if the content item is selected for the fixed position content item slot on a cost per impression basis, then the content item slot can be priced higher as the content item will be viewable for a longer period of time. In some implementations, when the parameter is passed to an auction, third-party content item providers may filter out eligible content items to deferentially select or select against the inventory via bid multipliers and or exclusions when the content item slot is fixed. In some implementations, when the position fixed parameter is transmitted to the 4 Burriesci et al.: DETECTION OF POSITION FIXED CONTENT ITEM SLOTS AND CONTROL OF CON Published by Technical Disclosure Commons, 2016 Error! Unknown document property name. content item selection system to quantify the prevalence of position fixed content item slots on a web page, web site, and/or network. In some implementations, when the position fixed parameter is transmitted to the content item selection system, an alert or other detection system can be triggered for policy enforcement. In still further implementations, when the position fixed parameter is transmitted to the content item selection system, the content item slot can be identified (e.g., based on a content item slot identifier) and used to generate a leads list for sales follow-ups. In some further implementations, the code for a web page, web site, etc. can be accessed and the scripts can be run offline to render a web page. A script can be executed to detect floating or position fixed content item slots. The content item slot identifier, other attributes of the content item slot, and/or the web page can be used to determine which protections, policy enforcement mechanism, and/or auction corrections can be triggered upon identifying a content item slot as a position fixed content item slot. 5 Defensive Publications Series, Art. 173 [2016] http://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/173", "year": 2016}

The need to build accountability into the IoT is motivated by the opaque nature of distributed data flows, inadequate consent mechanisms, and lack of interfaces enabling end-user control over the behaviours of internet-enabled devices. The lack of accountability precludes meaningful engagement by end-users with their personal data and poses a key challenge to creating user trust in the IoT and the reciprocal development of the digital economy. The EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) seeks to remedy this particular problem by mandating that a rapidly developing technological ecosystem be made accountable. In doing so it foregrounds new responsibilities for data controllers, including data protection by design and default, and new data subject rights such as the right to data portability. While GDPR is technologically neutral, it is nevertheless anticipated that realising the vision will turn upon effective technological development. Accordingly, this paper examines the notion of accountability, how it has been translated into systems design recommendations for the IoT, and how the IoT Databox puts key data protection principles into practice.", "year": 2018}

Early detection of tumors by breast exams and procedures can help to reduce these numbers. More medical practice is required. Professional training for medical procedures in real environments is costly and risky both for the student and the patient. A way to reduce costs and risks of training is by the use of a virtual simulator. An environment closer to the real world in medical simulations can provide a better quality experience of to the trainee. The use of haptic devices can emulate tactile sensations and feedback forces that correspond to body structures and density of tissues. The used device has six degrees of freedom (DOF): movement on three axes (x, y, and z), rotations, and horizontal and vertical inclinations. This work presents a virtual environment for breast exams practice and sentinel nodes detection procedures that employ the use of a haptic device and a gamified interface for feedbacks. The objective is to improve early breast cancer diagnosis chances. A model for tissue deformation calculations on tridimensional patient body mesh is proposed, to add visual realism to the interactions in the virtual environment. Needle depth and its tridimensional position data are updated at real-time on needle insertion. Tumor nodes size and position are dynamically generated upon each simulation, increasing training possibilities for the student. The gamification strategy improves the practice on environment, with elements to engage the player on activity. User progress is tracked by subdivision of breast exams and procedures into smaller challenges, for better performance evaluation on the virtual environment.

INTRODUCTION The world of the automotive industry is currently experiencing very rapid development. This is due to the growing middle class and the need for people to have means of transportation to support the mobility of the people who are getting busier. In recent years, the automotive industry in Indonesia is no longer dominated by Japanese and European manufacturers. This situation has an impact on the automotive business in Indonesia which is increasingly competitive. Along with the increasingly fierce competition, it is increasingly difficult for producers to maintain customer loyalty so as not to move to competitors (Susanto & Damayanti, 2008). This should be a big concern for automotive companies because all automotive companies will provide Volume 2, Issue 5, May 2021 E-ISSN : 2686-522X, P-ISSN : 2686-5211 Available Online: https://dinastipub.org/DIJMS Page 742 new, sophisticated features at competitive prices. Maintaining customer loyalty is a need that must be considered by every automotive company, both in Indonesia and in other countries. The Association of Indonesian Automotive Industries (Gaikindo) noted that car sales in Indonesia in wholesales from January to December 2019 reached 1,030,126 units. Table 1. Sales data of the 10 best-selling car brands in Indonesia in 2019 Merk Sales (In units) Toyota 331.797 Daihatsu 177.284 Honda 137.339 Mitsubishi Motors 119.011 Suzuki 100.383 Mitsubishi Fuso 42.754 Hino 31.068 Isuzu 25.270 Wuling 22.343 Nissan 12.302 Source: (Www.gaikindo.or.id, 2021) The table above shows that of the 10 best-selling car brands, Nissan ranks at the bottom with sales during 2019 of only 12,302 units. In Indonesia, PT. Nissan Motor Indonesia, as the agent for the Nissan brand, markets several models such as the Nissan Livina, Nissan X-Trail, Nissan Evalia, Nissan Teana, Nissan March, Nissan Terra, and Nissan Serena. Most of the models were produced at Nissan's factory in Purwakarta. Several models have discontinued sales in the last five years. In the last 10 years, Nissan has 'triumphed' by being ranked fifth best-selling in Indonesia in 2011 with sales of 56,137 units where Nissan controls 6.3 percent of the market share in Indonesia. Nissan's highest sales record was achieved in 2012 with 67,143 units (6 percent market share). However, in March 2020, PT. Nissan Motor Indonesia has officially stopped all of its factory activities in Indonesia and will only focus on sales and after-sales services to customers (Tempo.Co, 2020). sell when the COVID-19 pandemic plummets. But from month to month after slumping in April-May, the numbers are slowly rising. However, sales of Nissan brand cars were in freefall and Nissan\u2019s distribution continued to decline. Based on Gaikindo data in October 2020 wholesales Nissan only sold 37 units and all of them are supported by the recently launched Nissan Kicks e-Power. The distribution of other Nissan cars such as Livina, Serena, X-Trail, Terra, and Navara recorded zero units (Tempo.Co, 2020). Volume 2, Issue 5, May 2021 E-ISSN : 2686-522X, P-ISSN : 2686-5211 Available Online: https://dinastipub.org/DIJMS Page 743 Table 2.

Loyalty is an important factor in the automotive industry to survive in business competition. Loyalty is reflected in customer enthusiasm for the product or service. Many factors influence customer loyalty, especially in the automotive industry, such as brand image, customer value, and customer satisfaction, which are thought to play a role in Nissan customer loyalty. The research of (Gabrielle & Harjati, 2018) and (Yunaida, 2018) states that brand image and service quality have a positive and significant effect on customer loyalty. However, several previous studies, namely from (Suliyanto, 2013) and (Munisih & Soliha, 2015), showed a relatively low coefficient although significant between customer value and loyalty. Even research from (Wibowo, 2015) shows that the effect of satisfaction on loyalty is low and insignificant. Thus it can be concluded that although the variables of customer value, brand image, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty have been studied quite a lot, the findings from previous studies still leave a research gap, namely deficiencies in findings and the role of variable research in similar studies. Research findings in different populations can produce moderate coefficients but also low or insignificant coefficients. This is what causes the great interest of researchers to research similar research to fill the gap. To overcome this gap, we propose a model to fill the research gap from the results of previous findings on the low contribution of customer value independent variables. LITERATURE REVIEW Customer loyalty (Oliver, 2010) defines loyalty as a deep commitment from customers to buy/use goods/services repeatedly in the future. (Kotler & Keller, 2016) loyalty are a firmly held commitment to repurchasing selected goods/services in the future even though there are influences that cause customers to move to other products. The dimensions used are according to Griffin (Sangadji & Sopiah, 2013): (1) Making regular repeat purchases; loyal customers make purchases continuously, (2) Buying between lines of goods/services (purchase across products/service lines); loyal customers not only buy main goods/services but customers also buy other goods/services from the same producer, (3) Recommend to others (recommend to other); loyal customers will communicate by word of mouth regarding product excellence to others, (4) Show immunity from competing products Volume 2, Issue 5, May 2021 E-ISSN : 2686-522X, P-ISSN : 2686-5211 Available Online: https://dinastipub.org/DIJMS Page 744 (demonstrates on immunity to the full of competition); Loyal customers will refuse to use alternative goods/services offered by competitors. Customer Value According to (Kotler & Keller, 2016), customer value is the difference between customer assessment of all the benefits and costs of an offering against its alternatives. This shows customer value in terms of benefits and tradeoffs. Customers will compare the benefits obtained with the sacrifices made. If the benefits that are felt are greater than the sacrifice, the prospective customer will accept the offer given, but on the other hand, if the benefits received are felt to be less than the sacrifice, the prospective customer will leave the offer that is given. Organizations that focus on customer value will have an advantage in competing sustainably. (Roostika et al., 2010). The dimensions used are according to Sweeney and Soutar (Yeri et al., 2019): (1) Emotional value; the utility of positive feelings or emotions from consuming the product, (2) social value; the utility obtained from the product's ability to improve the customer's social self-concept; (3) quality/performance value; This dimension describes the overall value of service and product quality, (4) Price/value of money; it can be seen from the price of a product compared to the specifications and advantages provided. Brand Image According to (Kotler & Keller, 2016) brand image is a name, term, sign, symbol, design, or a combination of these, to identify and differentiate it from competitors' goods/services. According to (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2015) brand image is a different picture that is owned in the minds of consumers. The dimensions used are according to Keller (Salim & Dharmayanti, 2014): (1) Functional benefits; where the brand has a relationship with benefits in consumption of goods/services, (2) Symbolic benefits; related to the need for social recognition and self-esteem, (3) Experiential benefits; discuss what the customer feels after using the goods/services. (4) Social benefits; emphasizes on social needs when using these products, (5) Appearance enhances; discusses improving the appearance of consumers when using these products. Customer satisfaction (Kotler & Keller, 2016) define satisfaction as a person's feelings of pleasure/disappointment resulting from comparing performance/experience against expectations. If the performance/experience does not meet expectations, the customer is dissatisfied. If it matches expectations, the customer is satisfied. If you exceed expectations, the customer is very satisfied. (Peng & Moghavvemi, 2015) state that customer satisfaction is important because it can trigger customer loyalty. The dimensions used are according to Wilkie (Putri et al., 2016): (1) Expectations; customers will be satisfied if the goods/services received are by their expect", "year": 2021}

At NC State University, we have begun to deploy a scalable, low-cost, program level marketing system across 18 online and distance education programs. Programs that have deployed this system for two years or more have achieved 95-125% enrollment by the end of their second year in the program. The Status Quo: University Level Marketing Today\u2019s college applicants are heavily influenced by their online experience. Subramaniam, Wan Yusoff and Othman (2014, p. 94) found that the University\u2019s website had the greatest reach and influence on students\u2019 decision to choose that particular institution. In fact, a significant portion of prospective applicants (25%) will never look to sources outside of the web when shopping for education (EAB COE Forum, 2015, p. 27). While many universities recognize this and expend considerable resources on their web experience, it is often done by promoting the university as a whole, rather than specific programs. This approach can be inefficient: Search Term Inefficiency When buying a search engine term using pay-per-click, or attempting to optimize a website for a search term online, broad search terms are generally more competitive, and thus more expensive, than narrow search terms. Broad terms can also lead to low conversion rates because people using them have not yet decided what they want. For example, on February 27th, 2016, Google AdWords suggested a cost per click bid price of $42.67 for the keyword \u201cnc online degrees.\u201d At the same time, the keyword \u201conline master of statistics\u201d suggested bid price was only $4.94. Landing Page Inefficiency When marketing at the University level, prospective applicants have to navigate a web of likely inefficient search utilities or browse through department level sites to find the programs they are interested in. Even if the institution has a decent search interface, online and adult focused programs are likely to exist in a distance or adult learners section of the site. Analytics Inefficiency Traffic directed to University websites will often leave to go to a department website or course directory. Because most universities don\u2019t have one unified analytics system, it then becomes difficult to know where users are coming and going. This then makes it impossible to measure the Return On Investment for marketing expenditures. The Alternative: Program Level Marketing Lowry and Owens (2001) suggest that today\u2019s prospective students are career-oriented and focus on specific academic programs during their search, rather than the total offerings of the institution. Our experience has proved this out, and thus our hypothesis is that Universities can win the recruitment race by focusing marketing efforts at the program level. This starts with driving prospective students who know what they want to highly targeted websites that deliver a personally relevant experience. This leads to a lower cost per prospect, higher engagement, higher application rates and a high return on investment. While the program level is the optimal place to focus marketing attention, program coordinators are often responsible for recruiting with limited access to technical and marketing resources. Thus, to achieve our goals, we have deployed a low cost combination of web technology, marketing services and online community management best practices. The first component is a solid program level website that is focused on just one academic program or subject area, even if multiple related degrees are available. Content on the site should be constantly revised to account for new information, and should anticipate prospective students\u2019 needs. In a survey of college bound students, 88% of respondents indicated they would stop researching a school or be disappointed with the school if its website didn\u2019t provide the content they needed, and 80% said content was more important than design. In fact, more than half (57%) of respondents indicated they would remove a school from their list if the content on their website seemed dated, incorrect, or unhelpful (Noel-Levitz, 2009, p. 2). As such, the content on a program site should help prospective students see how these degrees can help them along their career path, answer key questions they have, and drive them to very specific points of engagement (such as contacting an advisor, requesting additional information, or applying to the program). Figure 1. A simple, program level homepage that directs users to the content they are most interested and a specific degree landing page with clear calls to action, promotion of the program advisor and good SEO content. Impeccable content, however, may not be sufficient to provide a positive website experience for a prospective student. We now live in a multiscreen world; 65% of online searches begin on a smartphone before transitioning to a different device, and 90% of adults use multiple screens sequentially to accomplish a task (EAB COE Forum, 2014, p. 11). Thus, the program site should be mobile and tablet optimized, with clear calls to action above the fold on every page. Pages should promote the contact information for advisors within that program to begin to build a human connection with the prospect. Next, you will need to deploy some basic Online Marketing. Campaigns should initially target audiences who have already shown an interest in the subject matter. While traditional University based advertising sends a broad message to a broad range of people, our marketing methodology aims to saturate the online experience of only the best prospective applicants. This begins with tie-ins from main university pages and continues with advertising in and optimization for Search Engines. This is a critical part of the system because  \u201conline marketing provides the best return on investment for enrollment; Google AdWords and SEO offer the two highest returns on investment within this sector\u201d (EAB AA Forum, 2014, p. 10). We then reinforce targeted messaging with remarketing ads, contextual banner ads, career-targeted LinkedIn ads and interest-based Facebook ads. Figure 2. Some real life examples of contextually targeted, pay per click ads served from Google AdWords, LinkedIn, Google Banner Ads, and Google Remarketing. The same basic ad templates were used for all programs. The third component is a focus on relationship building that seeks to quickly connect a prospect with their personal advisor via email responses, web conferences and phone calls. This relationship is then supported by monthly email marketing and regular personal outreach from their advisor. To compete within an ever-growing marketplace, a positive customer experience driven by personalized communication, especially during the recruiting process, is not just important it is increasingly a necessity (Wood, 2015). Another key relationship program coordinators should develop is with industry partners. This outreach can help establish key content partnerships, referral partnerships and deep links to the program website. Once the key marketing activities are in place, performance reporting is critical. Web analytics should be used to track each marketing activity, how it brings users to the site, what those users do on the site, and how they find and engage with the key calls to action (such as contacting an advisor, requesting information or beginning the application process). Figure 3. Clear and actionable analytics clearly articulate where prospects are coming from, what they are doing on the site and which engagement paths they are on. Finally, we suggest deploying professional marketing coaches that help put these systems in place, guide the program coordinator along the way, reviews the analytics to see what\u2019s working, and tweak the program to move closer to what works best and away from what doesn\u2019t. Following these best practices, we deployed online experiences for online and blended programs at NC State University over the past three years to great effect. Of the 3 Programs that have deployed this approach for over two years, all of them exceeded 95% of their target enrollment before the end of the second year. After participating in this approach for two years, one program declined to continue with the approach, only to see their enrollment drop 65% the following year. Of the 12 Programs have deployed this approach for more than one year, 50% of them have already met or exceeded their enrollment objectives. The average return on investment across these programs is 1340%. In conclusion, Universities who generally focus on university-wide and \u201cbrand\u201d marketing should consider broadening tactics to include more individual online and distance education program-level budgeting and marketing. Following these best practices at the program level drastically improves a program's likelihood of student recruitment success and self-sustainability.", "year": 2016}

Nowadays, when we talk about Human-Computer Interaction research, we are talking about multimodal interaction in environments where we research natural human behavior characteristics in general, rather than looking at keyboard and mouse interaction. The environments we live in support us in our activities. Sensor-equipped environments know about us, our activities, our preferences, and about our interactions in the past. This knowledge is obtained from our interaction behavior, behavior that can be observed and interpreted using knowledge that becomes available and that can be fused from cameras, microphones, and position sensors. This allows the environment to not only be reactive, but also proactive, anticipating the user\u2019s activities, needs and preferences. Less traditional sensors are now being introduced in the Human-Computer Interaction field. The aim is to gather as much information as possible from the human interaction partner and the context, including the interaction history, that can be sensed, interpreted, and stored. This information makes it possible for the environment to improve its performance when supporting its users or inhabitants in their daily activities. These sensors detect our activities, whether we move and how we move and they can be embedded in our clothes and in devices we carry with us. In the past, physiological sensors have been used to evaluate user interfaces. How does the user experience a particular user interface? What can we learn from information about heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductivity about how a user experiences a particular interface? Such information can help in improving the design of an interface. At present we see the introduction of these physiological sensors in devices we carry with us or that are embedded in devices that allow explicit control of computer or computer controlled environments. Hence, this information can be used \u2018on-line\u2019, that is, to improve the real-time interaction, rather than \u2018off-line\u2019, that is, to improve the quality of the interface.

This study aims to 1) understand older adults\u2019 perspectives on AMCs and their capacity to enhance healthcare through technological means; and 2) identify potential challenges and benefits of current technology in simplifying, streamlining, and enhancing care. Method Eight focus-groups(4 female; 4 male) were conducted with older adults (N=64) between April and May 2021 in The Villages - an active lifestyle retirement community in central Florida home to more than 140,000 older adults. Focus group domains explored included existing AMC knowledge and experience; prior/current technology exposure/use in day-to-day environments, for personal health, and within health systems including AMCs; perceptions of the benefits, challenges of health technology use; and preferences/suggestions for future use across environments. Demographic surveys were collected and analyzed via descriptive statistics. Focus-groups were transcribed, and content analysis identified salient themes. Results and Discussion Participants reported a mean age of 72.4 (SD=6.4) and rated their overall health 8.59/10 (SD=1.05). Across genders, themes of technology advancement in care coordination and delivery resonated strongly in AMCs, with preferences for pragmatic/simple-to-use advancements to foster effective engagement. Participants preferred simplified user-facing delivery systems (i.e. patient portals and health outcomes dashboards) and infrastructure (e.g., centralized electronic medical record systems) to \u201cavoid filling out the same form 6 times.\u201d Participants expressed feeling \u201cleft behind\u201d especially during technological updates, suggesting options for disabling automatic updates to allow time to learn changes; and highlighted need for design that supports accommodation for age-related-changes such as deficits in vision and hearing and onset of arthritis that often occur in late life and can limit efficacy in many existing technologies. AMCs have significant potential for engaging older adults in fostering sustainable, holistic, technology-enhanced care. Older adults value healthcare innovation, desire to assist progress, and expressed preference for cohesive, inclusive, and engaging technologies. AMCs are well-poised to engage these consumers and harness technologies to enhance healthcare-quality.

Gallovi\u010d, C. P. Evangelidis, A. Serpetsidaki, V. Plicka, J. Kosteleck\u00fd, and J. Zahradn\u00edk (2020). The 2018 Mw 6.8 Zakynthos, Greece, Earthquake: Dominant Strike-Slip Faulting near Subducting Slab, Seismol. Res. Lett. 91, 721\u2013732, doi: 10.1785/0220190169. Supplemental Material With different styles of faulting, the eastern Ionian Sea is an ideal natural laboratory to investigate interactions between adjacent faults during strong earthquakes. The 2018 Mw 6.8 Zakynthos earthquake, well recorded by broadband and strong-motion networks, provides an opportunity to resolve such faulting complexity. Here, we focus on waveform inversion and backprojection of strong-motion data, partly checked by coseismic Global Navigation Satellite System data. We show that the region is under subhorizontal southwest\u2013northeast compression, enabling mixed thrust faulting and strike-slip (SS) faulting. The 2018 mainshock consisted of two fault segments: a lowdip thrust, and a dominant, moderate-dip, right-lateral SS, both in the crust. Slip vectors, oriented to southwest, are consistent with platemotion. The sequence can be explained in terms of trench-orthogonal fractures in the subducting plate and reactivated faults in the upper plate. The 2018 event, and anMw 6.6 event of 1997, occurred near three localized swarms of 2016 and 2017. Future numerical models of the slab deformation and ocean-bottom seismometer observations may illuminate possible relations among earthquakes, swarms, and fluid paths in the region. Introduction Multiple faults acting during an earthquake have been generally well known, but on global scale less observations have been available for near-simultaneous ruptures of different faulting mechanisms, specifically in subduction zones. For example, Lay et al. (2013) reported a doublet of twoMw \u223c 7 events below Japan trench, where a thrust faulting (TF) along the subduction interface was followed after 14 s by a shallower normal faulting in the overriding plate. A rare evidence of a thrust event on a plate interface, which triggered a normal-faulting event in the overriding plate was provided for an Mw \u223c 7 earthquake in the Chile subduction zone (Hicks and Rietbrock, 2015). Particularly challenging in terms of strain partitioning are the regions where subduction terminates, and plate motions continue along transform faults. A good example is the 2016 Mw 7.8 earthquake in New Zealand, in which a dominant strike-slip (SS) faulting occurred in the upper plate and possibly triggered minor slip on the underlying subduction thrust (Mouslopoulou et al., 2019; Ulrich et al., 2019). Resolving fault complexity for strong earthquakes (Mw 6.0\u20136.9) in the shallowest parts of the subduction termination zones is even more challenging, and this article focuses on such a task in western Greece. The major ongoing convergent tectonic process in western Greece is subduction, imaged by seismic tomography and other structural studies (Spakman et al., 1993; Laigle et al., 2004; Suckale et al., 2009; Sachpazi et al., 2016; Halpaap et al., 2019). The active overriding of the Aegean plate over the subducting African plate, derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, is oriented toward southwest, approximately perpendicular to the trench, being consistent with slip vectors of many earthquakes (Kiratzi and Louvari, 2003; Hollenstein et al., 2006; Shaw and Jackson, 2010). Zakynthos (or Zante) Island is situated at a subduction-termination zone, a part of the Ionian Islands\u2013Akarnania Block (IAB) (P\u00e9rouse et al., 2017). At the northwest edge, this block is separated from Apulian\u2013Ionian microplate by the right-lateral Cephalonia transform fault. The southwest boundary of IAB is the Hellenic subduction backstop front. The northeast boundary of IAB is a mixture of SS and extensional structures (e.g., the Corinth Gulf). The southeast boundary of IAB has not been well known until the 2008Mw 6.3 Movri Mountain earthquake 1. Department of Geology, Seismological Laboratory, University of Patras, Patras, Greece; 2.

The interior of IAB, south of Zakynthos, is a zone of \u201cdiffuse deformation\u201d (P\u00e9rouse et al., 2017). Although being continuously seismically active, and being obviously related to shallow subduction process, its faulting style has not been understood yet. In this respect, the recent 2018 Mw 6.8 event plays an important role for seismotectonic interpretations in western Greece. Lessons learned here may apply also for other subduction-termination zones (Mouslopoulou et al., 2019), where the deformation partitioning between the slab and upper plate may take a variety of forms. Knowledge of the crustal structure of the studied region has been significantly improved by a mixed onshore and offshore (ocean-bottom) temporary seismic network (Papoulia et al., 2014). The latter study illuminated the spatial variation of the Moho depth, and provided a layered velocity model consistently used throughout this article. A weakly northeastdipping (\u223c5\u00b0) seismic reflector has been detected at the depth of \u223c10\u201315 km, supposedly mapping the top of the subducting plate in the area west and southwest of Zakynthos (Cl\u00e9ment et al., 2000; Laigle et al., 2004), situated \u223c10 km above Moho (Halpaap et al., 2019). Lacking more detailed information, in the following parts of this article we use the wellmapped Moho depth of Papoulia et al. (2014) and plot the slab top 10 km above the Moho. It provides an approximate (schematic) location of the slab top, at the depths 10\u201320 km, close to the above-cited reflector depths. In the instrumental era, the region near Zakynthos experienced three Mw 6\u20137 earthquakes, roughly every 20 yr (1959, 1976, 1997, and 2018), consistently with a high seismic coupling (Laigle et al., 2002; Chousianitis et al., 2015). No historicalM > 7 event has been documented. On 25 October 2018, at 22:54 UTC, an Mw 6.8 earthquake occurred southwest of Zakynthos. It caused limited damage on the island and no casualties (Institute of Engineering Seismology and Earthquake Engineering [ITSAK], 2018). The event was observed globally, and its broad characteristics were soon outlined as follows. The Global Centroid Moment Tensor (Global CMT) project suggested a centroid depth of 12 km, scalar moment M0 2:3 \u00d7 1019 N \u00b7 m, and strike/dip/rake angles of 13\u00b0/24\u00b0/165\u00b0, an oblique-TF mechanism. The Global CMT solution comprised a significant non-double-couple (non-DC) component, namely a compressional compensated linear vector dipole, CLVD \u221244%. The European data centers reported centroid depths <20 km, with focal mechanisms ranging from the mixed SS and thrust type to an almost pure SS, often with a notable non-DC component. For example, the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) published the moment tensor (MT) with CLVD of \u221261%. Interestingly, an Mw 4.8 foreshock was a pure low-dip thrusting mechanism (strike/dip/rake \u223c300\u00b0=10\u00b0=100\u00b0), similar to four major Mw 5+ aftershocks; however, smaller aftershocks were of both types, thrust and SS. Our preliminary analysis, reported to European Mediterranean Seismological Centre two weeks after the event, speculated about a segmented fault (Zahradn\u00edk et al., 2018). The goal of this article is to improve understanding of the complex faulting style taking place near Zakynthos, complementing our previous earthquake studies of the Ionian Sea islands of Lefkada and Cephalonia (Sokos et al., 2015, 2016). To this goal, we analyze source process of the 2018 mainshock and aftershocks using regional broadband, accelerometric, and GNSS data, considering also the 2011\u20132018 seismicity of the region. We interpret the mainshock in terms of a segmented source model, possibly related to trench-orthogonal fractures in the subducting plate and reactivated faults in the upper plate. Source Modeling Point-source models of mainshock and aftershocks The mainshock nucleated \u223c45 km southwest of Zakynthos, close to a local bathymetric low (the sea depth of 4 km; see Fig. 1). Exact hypocenter position is unknown because a small foreshock of an unknown position and magnitude preceded the mainshock by a few seconds, thus complicating the arrivaltime picking. For the same reason, the first-motion polarities are problematic. We made a probabilistic location (Lomax et al., 2001), see Text S1, and Figures S1 and S2 (available in the supplemental material to this article), pointing to a shallow depth, and hereafter we use the epicenter (latitude/longitude 37.27\u00b0/20.43\u00b0) corresponding to the arbitrarily fixed source depth of 5 km, with origin time of 22:54:47.5 UTC. None of the following modeling methodologies relies on the particular hypocenter position. A significant Mw 4.8 foreshock occurred 32 min before the mainshock (Fig. S1). The mainshock was followed by a standard exponentially decaying aftershock sequence that we first located with Hypoinverse (Klein, 2002), and then relocated with hypoDD code (Waldhauser, 2001). Their median formal errors are \u223c1 km, and a few hundred meters, respectively. The sequence included one Mw 5.1 event 15 min after mainshock, and four other events of Mw 5+ in the first week.

One is based on submarine sonar sounds, another relies on the target\u2019s coordinate plan x and y-axis, and the last uses direct voice instructions. The UIs were implemented in the Tactonom Reader device, a new tactile graphic reader that enhances swell paper graphics with pinpointed audio explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the three different dynamic navigation UIs, we conducted a within-subject usability test that involved 13 BVI participants. Beyond comparing the effectiveness of the different UIs, we observed and recorded the interaction of the visually impaired participants with the different navigation UI to further investigate their behavioral patterns during the interaction. We observed that user interfaces that required the user to move their hand in a straight direction were more likely to provoke frustration and were often perceived as challenging for blind and visually impaired people. The analysis revealed that the voice-based navigation UI guides the participant the fastest to the target and does not require prior training. This suggests that a voice-based navigation strategy is a promising approach for designing an accessible user interface for the blind.", "year": 2022}

Every year, many people suffer injuries that require rehabilitation. This entails considerable time overheads since it requires people to perform specified exercises under the direct supervision of a therapist. In this way, it is alluring that patients keep performing practices outside the facility (for example at home, along these lines without direct oversight), to supplement in-center non-intrusive treatment. Nonetheless, to accomplish mechanical recovery task roughly, patients need proper input, as differently gave by a physiotherapist, to ensure that these constrained management practices are accurately executed. Different approaches address this problem, providing feedback mechanisms to assist rehabilitation. Robot is \u201ca re-programmable, worldwide controller intended to move material, parts, instruments or concentrated gadgets by means of variable modified movements for the accomplishment of a spread of undertakings.\u201d Although this definition was intended for industrial robots, it identifies the key features of programmability, flexibility, and movement. Rehabilitation is \u201cthe restoration of an individual to an optimal level of physical, mental, and affair and well-being.\u201d Rehabilitation robots include diverse mechatronic devices starting from artificial limbs to robots for supporting the rehabilitation therapy or for providing personal benefit in hospital and residential set ups. Rehabilitation has been revolutionized with the use of robots in many parts of the world and much research is being done on in this field. In India\u2019s there is many hospitals and clinics are using robotic devices were installed .These devices are-- the Erigo, (For Early rehab), Lokomat (For Physiological gait training), Armeo (For Hand rehabilitation) etc. there are many devices. These devices are designed and manufactured by Hocoma. They will approach to provide real-time, active feedback, using multiple projection surfaces to provide effective visualizations by a physical therapist, with performance improvements between consecutive executions, a desirable goal to successful rehabilitation. There are two main types of rehabilitation robots. The first type is an assistive robot that substitutes for lost limb movements. An example is that the Manus ARM (assistive robotic controller), which may be a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm that is consist of employing a chin switch or other data input device. That mechanism is named telemanipulation and is analogous to an astronaut\u2019s controlling a spacecraft\u2019s robot arm from inside the spacecraft\u2019s cockpit. Powered wheelchairs are one more example of teleoperated, assistive robots. The second sort of rehabilitation robot may be a therapy robot, which is usually called a rehabilitator. Research in neuroscience has shown that the brain and medulla spinalis retain an interesting ability to adapt, even after injury, through the utilization of practiced movements. Therapy robots are machines or tools for rehabilitation therapists that grant patients to perform practice movements aided by the robot. The first robot utilized in that way, MIT-Manus, helped stroke patients to succeed in across a tabletop if they were unable to perform the task by themselves. Patients who received extra therapy from the robot improved the speed of their arm movement recovery. Another therapy robot, the Lokomat, supports the load of an individual and moves the legs during a walking pattern over a moving treadmill, with the goal of retraining the person to walk after spinal cord injury or stroke. Rehabilitation robotics may be a relatively young and rapidly growing field, with increasing penetration into the clinical environment. In the late 1980s and early 90s a few pioneering technological developments were launched, triggered by discoveries on training-induced recovery of sensorimotor function in animal models with damage to the central nervous system. The goal was to enhance the effects of functional training by providing increased therapy intensity and adaptive support in a controlled way. The idea of using machines for rehabilitation dates back much earlier. In a 1910 patent, Theodor Budingen proposed a \u2018development fix mechanical assembly\u2019, a machine driven by an electrical engine to direct and empower venturing developments in patients with heart condition. In the 1930s, Richard Scherb developed the \u2018meridian\u2019, a cable-driven apparatus to maneuver joints for orthopedic therapy. This human-powered mechanotherapy machine already supported multiple interaction modes, starting from passive to active-assisted and active-resisted movements. A first robotic rehabilitation system was based on the concept of continuous passive motion (CPM), a stiff interaction mode in which the robot moves the joints along a predefined trajectory, independent of the contribution of the patient. The first powered exoskeletons for therapeutic applications in SCI patients were introduced in the 1970s. These systems used pneumatic, hydraulic, or electromagnetic (via cams and Bowden cables) activators for position servo control. They included advanced features, such as actuated ankle flexion/extension, and hip adduction/abduction for increased stability or the ability of a therapist to control the motion of the exoskeleton worn by the patient through his/her own movement (in an identical , connected exoskeleton). The first system for robot-assisted therapy of stroke survivors was based on a stiff industrial manipulator and did not physically interact with patients, but rather moved a pad that patients had to touch to different locations. A new era of neurorehabilitation robotics began in 1989 with the development of the MIT-MANUS, which was first tested clinically in 1994. Identified with modern controllers, this planar manipulandum presents intrinsically low mechanical yield impedance (a recurrence subordinate protection from movement saw at the interface between the human client and in this manner the automated framework) and gives hold of the upper appendage against gravity, along these lines permitting to adjust backing to the seriousness of the shortfalls. A few years later, force-controlled devices for bimanual, cooperative grasping and lifting were introduced. This new generation of devices, using torque-controlled direct drive actuation, allowed for more advanced interaction control, ranging from passive movements for the most severely impaired patients, to active-assisted and active-resisted movements in moderately impaired patients. Furthermore, assistance could be automatically adapted to the patient\u2019s performance. Around the same time, the reflection Motion Enabler (MIME) was introduced, which supported paretic limb movements with a stiff industrial robot, controlled by the non-paretic limb by means of a motion digitizer (mirror-image therapy mode).", "year": 2020}

Due to their effectiveness in reducing users\u2019 information overload (Komiak and Benbasat, 2007) and facilitating users\u2019 decision-making process (Wang and Benbasat, 2008), AGSs have been considered as key influential factors of the success of online shopping websites in facilitating product customization and increasing revenue in ecommerce (Komiak and Benbasat 2006). First-generation AGSs generate advice by asking users to explicitly indicate their product attribute preferences or needs. Such systems are usually labelled as content-filtering recommendation agents (Wang and Benbasat, 2005) and provide users with recommendations that best meet their preferences. Users who rely on such advice-giving systems to make decisions need to have a clear idea about their needs, to spend effort in identifying them, and then expressing or conveying them to the AGS. In recent years, another kind of AGSs, what we will label as second-generation AGSs, have become increasingly popular. Examples of second-generation AGSs include recommendations that appear in the homepages of websites such as Amazon, eBay, and Netflix, and content/ad push in websites like Facebook and Twitter. Unlike first-generation AGSs which directly ask users to provide their inputs of needs, second-generation AGSs implicitly collect and identify users\u2019 information, such as users\u2019 demographic information, past browsing behaviors, purchase behaviors, relationships with other users (Briggs and Smyth, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012), etc., and use these information as the input for their advicegenerating process. In addition, compared to first-generation AGSs, second-generation AGSs employ more complex techniques to analyze data from a diverse set of input sources and generate advice for their users accordingly. Item-based collaborative filtering, an algorithm that generates advice similar to what users have adopted/bought before, and user-based collaborative filtering, an algorithm that offer users advice liked by other users who are similar to them, are basic techniques that support second-generation AGSs (Konstan and Riedl, 2012; Zhou et al., 2012). Based on these techniques, more advanced AGS models have already been suggested (Briggs and Smyth, 2006; O'Donovan and Smyth, 2005; Walter et al., 2008). For example, some researchers proposed a new kind of users-based collaborative filtering models that take into consideration the trust relationship among users (Zhou et al., 2012) to provide users with advice that are liked by other users whom they trust more. Due to the effective decision aids AGSs bring to website users, it is important for website managers to know how to maximize user adoption of their AGSs in order to attract more users and increase website profits. Trust, as a crucial influential factor in IT adoption, has been shown to have an influence on users\u2019 adoption of AGSs (Al-Natour et al., 2008; Komiak and Benbasat, 2006; Wang and Benbasat, 2005; 2008) and product purchase intentions (McKnight et al., 2002; Wang and Benbasat, 2007). UsTrust in Second-generation Advice-giving Systems Workshop on Designing User Assistance in Interactive Intelligent Systems, Portsmouth,UK, 2018 27 ers\u2019 trusts in AGSs can be influenced by a number of antecedents (for a summary, see S\u00f6llner, Benbasat, Gefen et al., 2016; S\u00f6llner and Leimeister, 2013). According to the framework developed by Wang and Benbasat (2008), we summarized the trust antecedents of AGSs, for both firstand secondgeneration ones that have already been studied in the existing literature, into six categories, namely dispositional reasons, institutional reasons, heuristic reasons, calculative reasons, interactive reasons, and knowledge-based reasons. Dispositional reasons include users\u2019 general predispositions to trust other parties. Institutional reasons include societal structures (e.g., legislation, rules, and third-party assurances) that people believe will make an environment trustworthy. Heuristic reasons include users\u2019 impressions of the website/e-vendor and users\u2019 past experiences with the system. Calculative reasons include users\u2019 perceived intelligence/efficiency/personalization of systems, users\u2019 privacy concerns, and users\u2019 perceived possibility/solutions of systems\u2019 mistakes/opportunistic behaviors. Interactive reasons include users\u2019 perceived control over systems, users\u2019 social presence, users\u2019 perceived ease of use, users\u2019 perceived similarity with systems, users\u2019 perceived adaptiveness of systems, users\u2019 decision confidence, etc. Knowledge-based reasons include explanations of how advice is generated/why AGSs ask certain questions. Over the past decade, users\u2019 trusts in first-generation AGSs have been thoroughly studied (Al\u2010Natour, et al., 2006; 2008; Komiak and Benbasat, 2006; Wang and Benbasat, 2005; 2007; etc.). However, our understanding of users\u2019 trusts in second-generation AGSs is in its infancy. Most of the existing research about second-generation AGSs are conducted from a technical perspective, focusing on how to design better algorithms in order to generate higher quality advice. Very few studies, the topics of which are related to users\u2019 perceptions on such systems, only roughly mention the potential trust risks due to the unique features of such systems and stay at the theoretical level. Hardly any empirical studies can be found in the literature. We argue for the necessity of studying users\u2019 trusts in secondgeneration AGSs because users may feel second-generation AGSs are less controllable and less transparent than first-generation ones due to the implicit elicitation of user needs and high complexity of advice-generating algorithms in second-generation AGSs. Accordingly, influential factors of users\u2019 trusts in second-generation AGSs may also be different from those in first-generation ones. Based on the literature, we picked out trust antecedents that were once studied in the context of second-generation AGSs. We found that researchers who studied trust antecedents of second-generation AGSs mainly focused on calculative reasons, interactive reasons, and know-based reasons. The trust antecedents they studied are either unique to second-generation AGSs or more important in the context of second-generation AGSs than that of first-generation AGSs. Accordingly, we proposed design suggestions for trustworthy second-generation AGSs. In order to increase users\u2019 trusts through affecting calculative reasons, we suggest that second-generation AGSs should be designed with intelligence high enough to keep bringing users \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d \u2013 recommendations that they have never thought of but will fall in love with at the first glimpse. We also suggest second-generation AGS designers to provide clear instructions about: a) what kind of user information they collect; b) when, how, and why they collect such information from users; and c) how they will use the collected information; and d) structural assurance that can ensure the privacy and security of users\u2019 input data. In order to increase users\u2019 trusts through affecting calculative reasons, we suggest designers create sufficient opportunities for users to provide feedbacks for previously generated advice to AGSs (e.g. whether users like the advice, why do users like/dislike the advice, etc.). In addition, we suggest designers create interfaces for human intervention when developing second-generation AGSs. In order to increase users\u2019 trusts through affecting knowledge-based reasons, we suggest designers indicate the input used for advice-generating process, use plain words to explain the complex advice-generating techniques, and avoid giving non-specific explanations such as \u201cHere are recommendations for you\u201d. Our research makes contributions in both academic and practical field. Unlike existing research focusing on the design AGS algorithms, we studied trust, a crucial factor of successful adoptions of such AGS technologies. To the best of our knowledge, our research is one of the first to systematically study trust issues on second-generation AGSs in the IS field. As for practical contributions, this paper helps system designers better develop second-generation AGSs by proposing detailed design suggestions.

In more general terms, Web APIs can connect almost anything to the world wide web. Unlike traditional software, APIs are not compiled, installed, or run. Instead, data are read (or consumed in API speak) through a web-based transaction, where a client makes a request and a server responds. Web APIs can be loosely grouped into two categories within the scope of biodiversity informatics, based on purpose. First, Product APIs deliver data products to end-users. Examples include the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and iNaturalist APIs. Designed and built to solve specific problems, web-based Service APIs are the second type and the focus of this presentation (referred to as Service APIs). Their primary function is to provide on-demand support to existing programmatic processes. Examples of this type include Elasticsearch Suggester API and geolocation, a service that delivers geographic locations from spatial input (latitude and longitude coordinates) (Pejic et al. 2010).\n Many challenges lie ahead for biodiversity informatics and the sharing of global biodiversity data (e.g., Blair et al. 2020). Service-driven, standardized web-based Service APIs that adhere to best practices within the scope of biodiversity informatics can provide the transformational change needed to address many of these issues. This presentation will highlight several critical areas of interest in the biodiversity data community, describing how Service APIs can address each individually.

Unfortunately, many innovative and promising technical solutions have fallen short not because of an inability to solve problems (Verner et al. 2008), rather, they were difficult to use, built in isolation, and/or designed without effective communication with stakeholders. Fortunately, projects such as Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012), the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (Robertson et al. 2014), and Megadetector (Microsoft 2021) provide the blueprint for successful community adoption of a technological solution within the biodiversity community. The final section of this presentation will examine the often overlooked non-technical aspects of this technical endeavor.

{"paperId": "2eb443d47b4c181d77a204acfdceff0be2bc433e", "title": "Welfare Properties of Recommender Systems", "abstract": "Recommender systems are ubiquitously used by online vendors as profitable tools to boost sales and enhance the purchase experience of their consumers. In recent literature, the value created by recommender systems are discussed extensively. In contrast, few researchers look at the negative side of the recommender systems from the viewpoint of policymakers. To fill this gap, I critically investigate the welfare impact of recommender systems (RSs) during my Ph.D. study. The main focus of my Ph.D. dissertation is analyzing whether there exists a conflict of interest between the recommendations provider and its consumers in the electronic marketplace. My dissertation is composed of three parts. In Part I, I evaluate empirically whether in the real world, the profit-driven firm will choose a recommendation mechanism that hurts or is suboptimal to its consumers. In Part II, I analyze the role of personalization technology in the RSs from a unique perspective of how personalization resembles price discrimination as a profitable tool to exploit consumer surplus. In part III, I investigate the vendor\u2019s motivation to increase the level of personalization in two-period transactions. As the RSs are designed by the firm, and the firm\u2019s objective is to maximize profits, the RSs might not maximize consumers\u2019 welfare. In Part I of my thesis work, I test the existence of such a conflict of interest between the firm and its consumers. I explore this question empirically with a concrete RS created by our industry collaborator for their Video-on-Demand (VoD) system. Using a large-scale dataset (300,000 users) from a randomized experiment on the VoD platform, I simulate seven RSs based on an exponential demand model with listed movie orders and prices as key inputs, estimated from the experimental dataset. The seven simulated RSs differ by the assignments of listed orders for selected recommended movies. Specifically, assignments are chosen to maximize profits, consumer surplus, social welfare, popularity (IMDB votes and IMDB ratings), and previous sales, as well as random assignments. As a result, the profit-driven recommender system generates 8% less consumer surplus than the consumer-driven RSs, providing evidence for a conflict of interest between the vendor and its consumers. Major e-vendors personalize recommendations by different algorithms that depend on how much and types of consumer information obtained. Therefore, the welfare evaluations of personalized recommendation strategies by empirical methods are hard to generalize. In Part II of my thesis, I base my analysis of personalization in RSs on a conceptual approach. Under an analytic framework of horizontal product differentiation and heterogenous consumer preferences, the resemblance of personalization to price discrimination in welfare properties is presented. Personalization is beneficial to consumers when more personalization leads to more adoption of recommendations, since it decreases search costs for more consumers. However, when the level surpasses a threshold when all consumers adopt, a more personalized RS decreases consumer surplus and only helps the firm to exploit surplus from consumers. The extreme case of perfect personalization generates the same welfare results as first-degree price discrimination where consumers get perfectly fit recommendations but are charged their willingness-to-pay. As shown in Part II, personalization is always profitable for the monopoly seller. In Part III, I investigate the vendor\u2019s motivation to increase the level of personalization in a two-period transactions. In the first period, consumers do not observe the true quality of the recommendations and choose to accept recommended products or not based on their initial guesses. In the second period, consumers fully learn the quality. The settings of consumer uncertainty and consumer learning incentivize the firm to charge lower-than-exploiting price for recommendations to ensure consumers\u2019 first-period adoptions of the RS. Therefore, uncertainties mediate the conflicts of interest from the vendor\u2019s exploitive behavior even though the vendor might strategically elevate consumers\u2019 initial evaluation to reduce such effect.", "year": 2017}

The benefits of e-learning include cost efficiency (Evans & Haase, 2001), easy and convenient 24/7 access from anywhere, scalability, and timeliness (Clarke & Hermens, 2001). The full benefits of e-learning cannot be realized if faculty do not adopt the new technology and fully use it to achieve their course design objectives. To achieve course design objectives, faculty need software that is pedagogically usable e.g., software that helps instructors implement good pedagogical principles in developing and implementing their courses. Usability theory has been widely examined in computer systems and web-based systems (Nielsen, 1993; Pearrow, 2000; Shneidermann, 1998; Agarwal & Venkatesh, 2002; Palmer, 2002; Venkatesh & Agarwal, 2006; Venkatesh & Ramesh, 2006), but few studies investigate the relevance and applicability of usability concept in the design of digital learning environments (Zaharias, 2005). Agrarwal and Venkatesh (2002) argue that the nature of the application and the type of user should be considered in developing a useful usability metric. The digital learning environment is a unique context for studying usability. In this unique context, each faculty member assumes the dual roles of application (i.e., on-line course) developer and system user. As course developers, they appropriate the functional and interface features embedded in the software to design the on-line course. As users, they use the system to communicate with students, monitor student activities, and evaluate student performance. Making an e-learning system usable basically involves two aspects: pedagogical usability and technical usability (Melis et al., 2003). Simply put, pedagogical usability aims at supporting the learning process while technical usability involves methods for ensuring a trouble-free interaction with the system. Technical usability is analogous to ease of use. While considerable attention has been focused on the ease of use construct (Lewis, 1995; Tilson et al., 1998; Raquel, 2001; Palmer, 2002), the construct of pedagogical usability of course management software has not been adequately addressed in the extant literature. This paper focuses on the pedagogical usability of CMSs in an e-learning context. Pedagogical usability is defined as the extent to which the CMS software helps the instructor implement good pedagogical practices. The pedagogical literature suggests Seven Principles (Chickering & Gamson, 1987) of instructional design that are good teaching methods for traditional as well as e-learning courses. Technology contributes to pedagogical objectives if it encourages contact between faculty and students, facilitates cooperation among students, uses active learning techniques, enables prompt feedback, emphasizes time on task, helps communicate high expectations, and respects diverse talents and ways of learning (Chickering & Ehrmann, 1996). If the power of CMSs is to be fully realized, e-learning technology should be designed to help faculty achieve these pedagogical goals. Based upon the information systems and elearning literatures, this study provides an initial exploratory model of pedagogical usability of CMSs from a faculty perspective. This model links CMS software design characteristics content re-configurability (Horton, 2000; Skyrme, 2001; Wild et al., 2002), interaction re-configurability (Kilby, 2001), and modularity design (WebCT Website at www.webct. com; Markus et al., 2002) with pedagogical usability.

It uses direct manipulation of the geometry to effect changes in the part model, and is based on a boundary representation database. This paper discusses the industry\u2019s perception and the value of every day usage of direct modeling, the future of this technology, and implications for engineering graphics educators. Introduction Direct modeling (DM), a.k.a. synchronous modeling or dynamic modeling, is an alternative approach to parametric, history-based solid modeling. Direct modeling is used as the core technology in a limited number of software systems such as SolidEdge and CoCreate, but none of these systems have been widely adopted by industry. Common solid modeling systems have recently added functionality within their software that mimics the user interface of direct modeling, including PTC Creo Elements/Direct, NX Synchronous Modeling, Catia Live Shape and SolidWorks Direct Editing. Software vendors claim that direct modeling solves numerous problems that are inherent with the use of history-based systems and facilitates model interoperability. What is Direct Modeling? Direct modeling is an intuitive approach to creating geometry without the burden of history-based dependencies. History-based (procedural) parameterization of models requires the user to thoughtfully consider the important model input/output parameters; independent dimensions are identified and defined by the user during model creation while dependent dimensions are calculated based on procedure (history tree rebuild). However, instead of storing the sequence of feature creation, a direct model is based on the boundary representation (b-rep) of the solid. The model is regenerated based on a set of geometric constraint equations rather than the sequential reconstruction of feature history. This is a simple but powerful method of specifying design intent, although implemented differently than in history-based models. Construction methods are similar to those used in conventional solid modeling; the user can design a 2D profile and then develop the model using commands like extrude, revolve, mill, bore, etc. Without the presence of a parameterized history tree, manipulation of the geometry is simplified, a major advantage of DM. Local geometry and topology changes can be made using both direct \u201cpush-pull\u201d interactions or using dimension-driven methods. Users can directly manipulate model geometry without needing to know how that geometry was created by simply grabbing, pulling and dragging faces, edges and features. Direct modeling also utilizes everyday software methods such as \u201ccopy/paste\u201d and \u201cdrag/drop\u201d. Direct modeling closely follows these Microsoft derived principles, which means the user can simply cut and paste elements from an existing design and start building an entirely new model. Advantages of Direct Modeling Direct modeling creates geometry rather than features so it is perfect for conceptual modeling where the designer doesn\u2019t want to be tied down with the interdependencies of features and the ramifications making a change might have. The direct modeling approach to 3D CAD provides an environment where users can design directly on the model\u2019s geometry. This is especially beneficial when creating one-off designs or facing unexpected and late changes in the design process. The direct modeling approach simplifies the design process, so pre-planning a modeling strategy is not necessary as compared to history-based modeling. Users working on existing models do not need to understand the modeling strategy used to create the model, and do not need to search through the feature tree to identify specific feature parameters in order to make a change to the geometry. The direct modeling approach facilitates quickness and responsiveness-to-change, making it an ideal approach where speed and flexibility are important. Due to the absence of the history tree, models created using the direct modeling approach exhibit greater interoperability. Files can be saved in standard formats such as STEP, Parasolid, or ACIS, and imported into other CAD packages without loss of information. Direct modeling is an ideal tool for manipulating imported geometry from other systems that generate a simple closed volume from these conversion formats. Variational direct modeling technology can automatically recognize design intent of a \u201cdumb\u201d geometry in the form of geometric and dimensional constraints between boundary elements. In applications that require interoperability between different CAD packages, some solid modeling systems can perform feature recognition, either automatically or through user interactions, thereby facilitating decomposition and simplification of neutral b-rep models in STEP, ACIS or Parasolid formats into features for analysis or manufacturing. These neutral file formats are representative of the direct modeling b-rep data structures. However, automatic feature recognition results in a sequence of features that seldom mimics the original features created by the designer, except for the simplest of parts. A moderately complex model of a chair, Figure 1 (left), contains a variety of features including extrusions, fillets, draft, sweep and loft, as well as a mirrored feature. The STEP file of this model, when imported using automatic feature recognition, yields fewer fillets, two revolves, two draft features, and a large volume of material that could not be featurized, shown as \u201cImported3\u201d, Figure 1 (right). No extrusions or pattern features were recognized. Only the geometry that is transformed into features can be edited in a conventional history-based solid modeling system. This would pose problems in making changes to the model for most regions within the geometry. With direct modeling, changes could be made to any surface or edge, whether on the recognized features or the unfeaturized volume. Figure 1. Conventional history-based model (left); featurized neutral STEP file (right). Direct modeling is ideal for freeform ergonomic parts and parts with complex surface geometry. Freeform manipulation of NURBS surfaces using push-pull operations is similar to modeling with clay. Ergonomic shapes can be easily combined with standard features to facilitate the creation of concept designs. Students and designers can create complex shapes using freeform modeling of NURBS surfaces, such as the beverage containers shown in Figure 2. These models, incorporating both freestyle NURBS-based features and conventional sketch-based features were created with Creo Parametric using a push/pull interface after a two hour introductory lab session. Figure 2. Freeform beverage containers designed by students Usefulness in Industry The concept of direct modeling has been around for more than 20 years yet only in the last few years have CAD vendors been marketing its capabilities. Although the major engineering CAD vendors have started to integrate direct modeling methods into their products, significant differences in implementation and functionality are currently observed. While some CAD vendors claim to incorporate direct modeling into their products, these implementations are in the form of a hybrid system, which mimics the user interface and manipulation modes of DM, but retains the history-based data structure. In these hybrid systems, the geometry manipulations appear in the model tree as \u201cmove\u201d, \u201ccopy\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d features, alongside the conventional solid features, as shown in Figure 3. The user interface supports direct manipulation of the part geometry and push-pull interactions. NX Synchronous offers an option to convert a history-based model with a history-free one but cautions users that all the history will be deleted. It is not recommended for highly engineered production parts. It\u2019s unclear if the part history is truly deleted or just \u201chidden\u201d. These hybrid systems may facilitate user interaction with the model while making design changes, but tend to complicate the history tree, resulting in less robust models. Figure 3. Part with featureless model tree (left) and \u201cmove\u201d feature in conventional feature-based model tree (right). A limited survey of industry users has shown that many design engineers do not utilize the direct modeling functionality and in some cases users do not even know that the direct modeling add on modules exist. Interviews (teleconferencing, emailing and in-person) yielded the following testimonials by experienced CAD professionals working in various industries. \u201cAfter hearing about the Direct Editing feature in SolidWorks, I did some research and started playing around with it. It\u2019s fun to play with but seems to be a novelty and has no real use in the design / manufacturing of our product\u201d. \u201cWe use PTC Creo and SolidWorks, but no one here uses any part of the Creo Direct or [SolidWorks] Direct Editing modules\u201d. \u201cUTC is using PTC Creo, but we don\u2019t do anything with direct modeling that I have seen\u201d. We have been using SolidWorks for many years and have never heard of the Direct Editing feature\u201d. Parametric, history-based CAD is considered to be unsuitable for use in the concept phase due to the lack of knowledge regarding suitable parameterization of the model and feature dependencies. Conceptual design development is a process where many threads of possibilities are developed in parallel. Although the use of direct modeling has been limited in industry, it is primarily being used in the concept / prototype phase for new projects where producing multiple \u201cquick and dirty\u201d concepts is necessary. After the concept has been adequately defined, companies are transferring the project to the history-based modeling packages to create assemblies and to document the design through to the 2D detail drawing phase. Direct modeling may also be used in manufacturing, where interoperability is necessary due to the use of different software between desig", "year": 2016}

A major leap through in this scenario is obtained by embedding, in the physical environment, sensors capable of detecting and processing users' context (position, pose, gaze, ...). Feeded by the so collected information flows, user interface paradigms may shift from stereotyped gestures on physical devices, to more direct and intuitive ones that reduce the semantic gap between the action and the corresponding system reaction or even anticipate the user's needs, thus limiting the overall learning effort and increasing user satisfaction. In order to make this process effective, the context of the user (i.e. where s/he is, what is s/he doing, who s/he is, what are her/his preferences and also actual perception and needs) must be properly understood. While collecting data on some aspects can be easy, interpreting them all in a meaningful way in order to improve the overall user experience is much harder. This is more evident when we consider informal learning environments like museums, i.e. places that are designed to elicit visitor response towards the artifacts on display and the cultural themes proposed. In such a situation, in fact, the system should adapt to the attention paid by the user choosing the appropriate content for the user's purposes, presenting an intuitive interface to navigate it.

Approximately 70% of computer users have vision-related problems. For these reasons, properly designed interventions for users with CVS are required. To design an effective screen intervention for preventing or improving CVS, we must understand the effective interfaces of computer-based interventions. Objective In this study, we aimed to explore the interface elements of computer-based interventions for CVS to set design guidelines based on the pros and cons of each interface element. Methods We conducted an iterative user study to achieve our research objective. First, we conducted a workshop to evaluate the overall interface elements that were included in previous systems for CVS (n=7). Through the workshop, participants evaluated existing interface elements. Based on the evaluation results, we eliminated the elements that negatively affect intervention outcomes. Second, we designed our prototype system LiquidEye that includes multiple interface options (n=11). Interface options included interface elements that were positively evaluated in the workshop study. Lastly, we deployed LiquidEye in the real world to see how the included elements affected the intervention outcomes. Participants used LiquidEye for 14 days, and during this period, we collected participants\u2019 daily logs (n=680). Additionally, we conducted prestudy and poststudy surveys, and poststudy interviews to explore how each interface element affects participation in the system. Results User data logs collected from the 14 days of deployment were analyzed with multiple regression analysis to explore the interface elements affecting user participation in the intervention (LiquidEye). Statistically significant elements were the instruction page of the eye resting strategy (P=.01), goal setting of the resting period (P=.009), compliment feedback after completing resting (P<.001), a mid-size popup window (P=.02), and CVS symptom-like effects (P=.004). Conclusions Based on the study results, we suggested design implications to consider when designing computer-based interventions for CVS. The sophisticated design of the customization interface can make it possible for users to use the system more interactively, which can result in higher engagement in managing eye conditions. There are important technical challenges that still need to be addressed, but given the fact that this study was able to clarify the various factors related to computer-based interventions, the findings are expected to contribute greatly to the research of various computer-based intervention designs in the future.", "year": 2021}

This is claimed to improve performance, shorten recovery and prevent \ninjuries. The level of pressure applied by SCGs is affected by a complex \ninteraction of body dimensions, garment characteristics and fabric properties. With \nmost existing research on SCGs drawn from medical or sports science fields, \nstudies frequently neglect considerations of users and the way SCGs behave on \nthe body. Consequently, the SCG-body-relationship is not well understood and the \npressures applied by commercial SCGs vary widely. This research set out to \nenhance theoretical and practical knowledge on the design of SCGs by defining a \nframework for the design of SCGs with controlled pressure. To achieve this, user \nexperiences with SCGs were obtained through an online survey and wearer trials \nand the designs and pressure distributions of commercial SCGs were analysed. \nThe research further assessed the feasibility of using the built-in pressure map of \nthe commercial 3D CAD software Optitex PDS 11 to predict pressures applied by \nSCGs. \nFindings from the online survey revealed that respondents were overwhelmingly \nsatisfied with commercial SGCs and that they wore SCGs mainly for their \nrecovery-enhancing rather than performance-enhancing properties. Wearer trials \nwith 33 physically active females in SCGs were conducted to capture 3D scans of \ntheir bodies and measure the pressure applied by commercial SCGs. The wearer \ntrials indicated that, despite high levels of user satisfaction identified by the online \nsurvey, compression levels varied widely across pressure measurement locations \nand across individuals. This suggests a strong perceptual effect of SCGs. It was \nconcluded that variations in pressure levels were likely to be associated with \nvariations in fit and fabric tension caused by deficiencies in the applied sizing \nsystem. \nThe commercial SCGs under investigation were deconstructed, re-engineered and \nvirtually fitted to a set of remodelled body avatars of 15 wearer trial participants. \nVirtual pressure measurements were compared to in vivo measurements.

Information bubbles further contribute to these divisions: People prefer to consume content they feel familiar with and see views they agree with. Yet, pluralism and viewpoint diversity are necessary for a well-functioning democracy. In this paper, we explore how we can design interfaces that dial down partisan antipathy and allow users with opposing viewpoints to understand one another. We study ChangeMyView (CMV) subreddit, a community that encourages users to change their opinion by inviting reasoned counterarguments from other members. We use interviews with 15 CMV members to gain insights about the design mechanisms and social norms that allow this community to function well. We also explore how we can replicate such civil interactions between users with different ideologies on other platforms. INTRODUCTION \u201cCyberspace does not have the power to make us anything other than what we already are. Information doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to understanding or change. It is a revealing, not a transforming, medium. ... Understanding or change happens, but it is as rare and as hard to get to online as it is anywhere else\u201d\u2014Stacy Horn [24]. In the past few years, there have been growing concerns that the United States is becoming increasingly politically polarized [10,14]. According to a 2014 Pew Research study, Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines than at any other time in the last two decades [10]. Liberals and conservatives prefer to live near their fellow partisans. They say they would be unhappy welcoming someone with a different political viewpoint in their family [10]. A 2016 follow up to this study found growing ideological divisions along educational and generational lines [11]. These results show a divided society where individuals with opposing ideologies are increasingly keeping apart from one another. Americans are divided on issues like gender equality, climate change, gun control, foreign policy, etc. Such divisions preclude public deliberation that can help people make better decisions and uncover new solutions [18,25]. They also hurt communities by reducing opportunities to gain social capital from individuals with opposing views [38]. The polarized views of the public are also firmly embedded in their elected representatives and this prevents a lot of meaningful progress. It is challenging for people to listen to perspectives that contradict their own views [25,32]. Some scholars have warned that when users are afforded unprecedented access to information from around the world, they are likely to exclude political opinions with which they disagree [33]. This has led to concerns that the Internet may promote an increasingly polarized citizenry [17,44]. Prior research has also shown that while political discussions and public deliberation are important for healthy democracies, they face challenges online [17,21,39]. Many online spaces mirror and in some cases, reinforce polarization. For example, Adamic & Glance studied the linking patterns of political bloggers and found that liberals and conservatives link primarily within their separate communities [2]. Researchers have also argued that information filters like recommender systems and search rankings isolate people in information bubbles that further contributes to polarization [35,41]. In this research, we set out to study how interactive systems can help mitigate this growing polarization by enabling civil discussions between users with different ideologies. We wanted to understand how designers can create online spaces where users can have serious but cordial conversation about delicate issues with others they disagree with. We believe that enabling such discussions would help users find common ground, build public trust, mitigate polarization and improve our collective ability to find solutions to common problems. To this end, we chose to study Change My View (CMV) subreddit, a discussion forum where users invite others to change their view on any opinion by providing reasoned arguments. We wanted to understand: What motivates many CMV users to continue being open to changing their view? What drives users to engage in meaningful conversations with people they disagree with? What design features and social norms of the CMV community help its users engage in civil conversations about sensitive topics 1 www.reddit.com/r/changemyview GVU Technical Report Dec 12, 2017 that do not devolve into fights? Does posting on CMV really change people\u2019s minds? To answer these questions, we conducted participant observation on CMV and interviewed 15 members of the community. We interpret our findings in light of social psychological theories of how environmental and social cues influence behavior in interpersonal situations. We also discuss the implications of these findings for designing spaces that motivate constructive discussions on other online forums. We begin with a discussion of previous research in HCI on communicating across differences. Following this, we briefly discuss gamification and Focus Theory of Normative Conduct. We build on this discussion later to unpack our findings about CMV. We then present our study design. Next, we briefly describe the CMV community followed by our findings. Finally, we discuss the lessons that we can learn from this case study for design of other communities that foster civil conversations. RELATED WORK AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Communicating Across Differences While online communities lower the barriers for anyone interested in participating in public discourse, selective exposure [16] prevents people from accessing diverse perspectives because individuals favor information that reinforces their current views. Many online spaces for discussions are clustered into groups of like-minded users [28,39]. Researchers have shown the prevalence of \u201cecho chambers\u201d or \u201cfilter bubble\u201d effects in social network sites [12,19]. Associating with similar others can be reassuring, but this tendency can exacerbate polarization. On the other hand, exposure to diverse viewpoints can contribute new information and lead to better decisions [21]. Many researchers in HCI and CSCW have looked into bridging across political differences [4,12,20,21,30,43]. They have introduced tools, interfaces and social mechanisms that discourage polarization by promoting listening and encouraging exploration of diverse opinions. For example, ConsiderIt [25], an open-source deliberation platform developed at the University of Washington invites users to think about the tradeoffs of a proposed action by creating a pro/con list. Added social layers allow users to browse others\u2019 lists and include the points they like into their own list. This allows users to gain insights into others\u2019 perspectives. Reflect [26] promotes active listening and deliberation by adding a space next to every comment and asking users to summarize the points they hear the commenters making. Munson et al. deployed a browser extension that showed users feedback about political lean of their reading behaviors [31]. We build on this rich body of work to consider how individuals who oppose one another can learn to think and behave in ways that may be seen as constructive and improve the quality of their online contributions. This problem is complex and challenging [21]. Some researchers have argued that displaying opposing views can influence people to more strongly adhere to their original position [30,45]. However, on CMV, users often listen to opposing positions and change their original view. We use the case study of CMV to derive design principles that can guide the creation of interfaces that aim at encouraging people to be open to changing their views and facilitating civil discourse", "year": 2017}

However, several challenges face the targeting of PPIs, including large PPI interface areas, a lack of deep pockets, the presence of noncontiguous binding sites, and a general lack of natural ligands. The presence of hot spots (small subsets of amino acid residues that contribute significantly to free binding energy) makes PPIs amenable to small molecule perturbations, playing essential roles in the stability of protein binding. Effectively identifying which specific interface residues of protein protein complexes form the hot spots is critical for understanding the principles of protein interactions and has broad application prospects in protein design and drug development.

Since the digital medium is more open to variations than the once traditional form of presenting Scholarly Editions in printed book form, discussions on how to deal with the new possibilities started at a very early stage after the emergence of digital scholarly editions. In the beginning these were strongly influenced by traditional presentation practices but have shifted to aspects more associated with the digital paradigm. Theoretical approaches towards interfaces, however, were only sporadically published and have been continuously demanded by the scholarly community. This introduction attempts to summarize the scholarly discussions on interfaces and provides an overview of the papers presented in these proceedings: they offer both theoretical approaches and discussions of practical implementations together with studies evaluating interfaces. Early 2016, a heated discussion sparked off at the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz about the role of interfaces in digital scholarly editions (DSE) and the question of whether the DSE itself takes up the role of an interface between documents, users and machines. This discussion led to the decision to hold a conference about the topic in September of the same year entitled \u201cDigital Scholarly Editions as Interfaces\u201d. The aspired format for the conference was a moderate setting to provide a stage for early career researchers and the fellows of the Digital Scholarly Editions Initial Training Network DiXiT, a European Commission Marie SklodowskaCurie Action, to present their projects, ideas and ongoing research on the relationship between interface and DSE.The overwhelming response to the call for papers revealed the strong interest in this topic of the Digital Humanities (DH) community. The result was a densely packed two day symposiumwith an international audience and speakers. Accounts of the event can be found on the DiXiT blog (Bleier et al., \u201cReport\u201d) and on H-Soz-Kult (Bleier et al., \u201cTagungsbericht\u201d). The conference programme was framed by two inspiring keynote presentations by Dot Porter of the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and Stan Ruecker of the School of Art and Design at the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois. Porter opened the conference. In VI Roman Bleier, Helmut W. Klug her presentation \u201cWhat is an edition anyway?\u201d she discussed different definitions of edition and revealed the results of her latest survey on the usage of editions (printed, digitized, and digital). She related the survey results to her earlier surveys (from 2002 and 2011) and showed that a certain inhibition threshold exists towards using the digital medium as means of presentation. Her bold closing statement \u201cData over Interface\u201d provided plenty of grounds for lively discussions throughout the conference whether the data or the interface are the integral part of a DSE, and in consequence, whether the machine or the human user is the primary addressee of a DSE. In contrast, Stan Ruecker set the focus of his keynote on the aspect of the design process in general and the design of creative and experimental interfaces for Humanities and Cultural Heritage purposes in particular. He emphasized his arguments with examples from various research and design projects strongly focusing on the experience of scholarly readers. He concluded that the social and dynamic aspect of scholarly reading should play a more important role in the designing of DSEs. According to the Oxford English Dictionary interfaces are: A means or place of interaction between two systems, organizations, etc.; a meeting-point or common ground between two parties, systems, or disciplines; also, interaction, liaison, dialogue. This rather general definition still hints at the complexities the concept of \u201cthe interface\u201d incorporates. In DH it not only contrasts humanities with computer sciences and design aspects but also human to humanwithmachine tomachine communication as well as human computer interaction. The role of the interface and along with this role, its definition varies according to the person, domain, interest, use (etc.) it is associated with. Interface research deals with a vast complexity of the research topic, the amount and particular structure of humanities\u2019 data, as well as the diverse collection of affected research domains. Equally demanding are the rapidly evolving technology, with the ever changing demands on both publishers and recipients of editions and interfaces. Additionally, over hundreds of years the distribution of knowledge has been associated with the form and feel of the book (Burdick et al. 139). The Scholarly Edition has a long tradition in print and, hence, these experiences and associations with the printed edition strongly shape the way how DSEs are designed today. However, is it indeed necessary for editors to use a skeuomorphic design approach, trying to mimic the book? Are only DSEs that follow the in order to accepted and used by the scholarly community? To what extend does such an approach hinder innovation and the development of more efficient solutions for DSEs? (Pierazzo 170\u2013175) Understanding the DSE itself as an interface means understanding it as a connection point between historical documents and the user, whether a human being or amachine. Discussing Interfaces in Digital Scholarly Editing VII Accordingly, we are usually confronted with two types of interfaces in DSEs: the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and the Application Programming Interface (API). GUIs are a central means of communication between human users and machines. They are central to research as many researchers are not accessing the data produced by a digital scholarly edition directly, but prefer a graphical layer that presents research data for reading, studying and analyzing. The GUI lets the user navigate through the research material and the web presentation built around it. However, it has to be remembered that an interface (GUI or API) of a DSE is always closely linked to the data model of the underlying data and the editorial principles expressed in this data model, in that regard it is a form of pre-selective data management. Interfaces are an interpretation of knowledge and provide users with a more or less \u201cguided tour\u201d through the data and its general presentational setting. Furthermore, they allow the user to answer research questions and aim at supporting the generation of knowledge. Over the last decade the already mentioned APIs have gained importance for DSEs as editors increasingly see their editions not only as static texts published online, but as data that can be linked to other data to answer interesting research questions. The API allows data exchange on a machine to machine level which results in a \u201cguided tour\u201d from DSEs that can be aggregated, interlinked with each other and used to address further research questions by other agents. As early as the turn of the century, Bethany Nowviskie aligned the highly technically connoted term \u201cinterface\u201d to digital scholarly editing, demanding in the middle of the initial enthusiasm a stronger theoretical reflection of the possibilities the (then) new media posed. A critical examination of the topic has also been demanded very early by Jerome McGann in 2001 (171): He witnessed the slow change from a bibliographical to an interface culture. McGann argues for a meaningful exploitation of the familiar media and an aesthetic digital conversion process since, according to him, scholarly book and digital culture do have much in common. What he is missing, however, is the reflective capacity of the digital tools and it is here that he would anchor the potential of the interface. Years later, the critique that the user interface is broadly neglected in the conception of the DSE was verbalized by Hans Walter Gabler in 2010 (48). For him, the user of an edition is still trapped in the traditional receiving role. Editors do not see the user as an equal or peer, and participation in or interaction with a digital edition is not a task available for the user. Envisioning the DSE as the future medium of scholarly editing, Gabler considers the active user involvement to be highly significant. The challenge of social editions, however, lies not in the technical difficulties, as interfaces and workflows are already available, but revolves around theoretical and methodological questions (Brumfield; Robinson, \u201cTheory of Digital Editions\u201d 122). Similarly, Michael Sperberg-McQueen (30) sees editors migrating from an unruly but well-known (print) to a chaotic, unpredictable environment (digital). One of his VIII Roman Bleier, Helmut W. Klug solutions to get back a solid user base is to provide problem-solving interfaces. In order to meet these needs of humanities scholars Roberto Rosselli Del Turco (\u201cAfter the Editing\u201d) was one of the first to introduce a set of design elements DSEs should provide beyond general interface functionalities: these include for example hypertext functionalities, special character handling, image manipulation, advanced search, and complementary data manipulation tools. The demand for a theoretical approach towards the roles the interfaces of a digital edition have to offer was taken up more recently by Patrick Sahle (\u201cScholarly Digital Edition\u201d 159f.) who points out that as a digital presentation an edition is no longer just data but also design and program code, and in a digital edition one cannot live without the other. A theory of digital editing would have to assess the importance, define the relationship, and estimate the interdependency of data and interface(s), i.e. content and form. It would also have to consider the interaction between historical source, editor and user. Sahle, like others before him, strongly calls fo", "year": 2018}

Drug repositioning offers the promise of reducing drug development timeframes and costs, and because it involves drugs that are already in the clinic, it might remedy some of the drug safety challenges traditionally associated with drug candidates that are not yet available in the clinic. The gene-by-drug interactions are an important dimension of optimal drug repositioning and development strategies. While gene-by-drug interactions have been curated and presented in various databases, novel bioinformatics tools and approaches are timely, and required with a specific focus to support drug positioning. We report, in this study, the design of a public web-accessible transcriptomic-/gene expression-guided pharmaceuticals search tool, geneXpharma ( www.genexpharma.org ). GeneXpharma is a public platform with user-centric interface that provides statistically evaluated gene expressions and their drug interactions for 48 diseases under seven different disease categories. GeneXpharma is designed and organized to generate hypotheses on druggable genome within the disease-gene-drug triad and thus, help repositioning of drugs against diseases. The search system accommodates various entry points using drugs, genes, or diseases, which then enable researchers to extract drug repurposing candidates and readily export for further evaluation. Future developments aim to improve the geneXpharma algorithm, enrich its content, and enhance the website interface through addition of network visualizations and graphical display items. Bioinformatics search tools can help enable the convergence of drug repositioning and gene-by-drug interactions so as to further optimize drug development efforts in the future.", "year": 2017}

The goal of the proposed prototypes is to attract passers-by to such systems in public space by making them curious. \nThis is summarized in the main research question: How can careful prototyping based on established theories, design principles, guidelines and models be used to design interactive floor systems which attract passers-by in semi-public space? The sub questions guided my approach of research in related work and user testing. \nThe evaluation of this thesis suggests that the visibility of the interface greatly influences its noticeability and engagement, since visual feedback is a strong engaging factor. Between students, interface experts and OpenHouse visitors, \u201cVote\u201c was the least effective proposed concept. The \u201cUncover\u201c prototype performed strong, however the slightly more goal-relatedness of the \u201cBuzz\u201c prototype introduced competition, which additionally boosted the motivation of its users, and made it the most effective at attracting passers-by. To outline my findings, interactive floor systems should improve their visibility as much as possible, since visual feedback is their strongest engaging factor, tailor their game content to their specific target group and environment, and eventually give hints about underlying functions in order to get users interested in the system. Competition, visual and auditory feedback are concluded to be highly effective in grabbing passers-by attention.", "year": 2018}

Using a cross-project approach, this paper examines the prevalence, effectiveness and inclusiveness of 84 SLEETs deployed in 72 local energy projects in the UK from 2008 to 2018. An original framework for the characterisation of SLEETs was employed, which grouped them into seven types and characterised them in terms of their level of interaction and interface design. Our study shows that information-driven tools were the most popular in community energy groups, while digital energy platforms or interaction tools with numeric interfaces were the most popular in smart local energy system (SLES) initiatives. In contrast, interaction tools with visual interfaces, and tools offering control were found to be less popular. Spatial analysis revealed that SLEETs were mostly deployed in areas with grid constraints (technology), active community energy groups (people) and engaged local authorities (policy). Effective SLEETs were found to stimulate engagement amongst people (social engagement), and between people and technology (operation and control), while inclusive SLEETs enabled the inclusion of vulnerable and low-income households. The acceptance and implementation of SLES initiatives can be enhanced by creating effective and inclusive SLEETs that align with local users\u2019 requirements and are supported by local stakeholders in order to foster trust. In future, there is a need to develop appropriate metrics (key performance indicator) or scoring methods to measure the prevalence, effectiveness, and inclusiveness of SLEETs in a consistent manner.", "year": 2023}

From a sociotechnical perspective, these scenarios depict situations in which non-human and human agents are likely to work together in order to achieve a common goal. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are often viewed as a convenient and cost effective way to gather information that is not easily accessible from any other means. However, we are beginning to see increasing efforts to scale up the autonomy of single-UAV systems to create aerial swarms. It is thought that aerial swarms may be used to assist in various situations including search and rescue missions, warehouse operations and military scenarios. Compared to a single robot, a swarm can provide a more efficient means to cover large areas and are scalable (i.e., can easily add or remove individual robots without significantly impacting the performance of the remaining group). Despite this, there has been some concern that Human Factors research into human-swarm partnerships is lacking. Thus, in order to understand the current \u2018state of the art\u2019, a systematic literature review was conducted to explore what Human Factors research is being conducted within the area of human-swarm partnerships and explore what design guidance exists to support the development of efficient and effective relationships. The initial search returned 143 articles. Duplicates were first removed and then the screening process involved filtering articles by titles then by abstract and then finally, full text. This approach led to 55 articles being retained. Inductive coding was used to identify themes within the text. This provided greater insight into the current focus of research with the context of human-swarm partnerships. A total of 5 themes were identified: interaction strategies, user interface design, management, operator monitoring and trust. However, the review also found that when it comes to design guidance, very little is available. One potential avenue for future research centre on the concepts of Meaningful Human Control and Effective Human Control. These concepts have been recognised as providing the foundation in which the design of human-swarm partnerships may be developed. This is because human agents are still likely to play a pivotal role in overall mission success and as such should retain full decisional awareness and possess a comprehensive understanding of the context of action in order for control to be meaningful. This implicates four of the research themes identified as part of this review: interaction strategies, user interface design, management and trust. Operator Monitoring, the final theme identified as part of this review, is indirectly linked to MHC and EHC because it acts as the mechanism in which operator engagement can be augmented. Arguably then, the building blocks to achieve MHC and EHC are beginning to take shape. However, more research is needed to bring this altogether in the quest for efficient and effective relationships between human agents and robot counterparts.", "year": 2023}

To investigate large-scale biological phenomena in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with CG models, unified treatments of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as efficient parallel computations, are indispensable. In the GENESIS MD software, we implement several residue-level CG models, covering structure-based and context-based potentials for both well-folded biomolecules and intrinsically disordered regions. An amino acid residue in protein is represented as a single CG particle centered at the C\u03b1 atom position, while a nucleotide in RNA or DNA is modeled with three beads. Then, a single CG particle represents around ten heavy atoms in both proteins and nucleic acids. The input data in CG MD simulations are treated as GROMACS-style input files generated from a newly developed toolbox, GENESIS-CG-tool. To optimize the performance in CG MD simulations, we utilize multiple neighbor lists, each of which is attached to a different nonbonded interaction potential in the cell-linked list method. We found that random number generations for Gaussian distributions in the Langevin thermostat are one of the bottlenecks in CG MD simulations. Therefore, we parallelize the computations with message-passing-interface (MPI) to improve the performance on PC clusters or supercomputers. We simulate Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 B-capsid and chromatin models containing more than 1,000 nucleosomes in GENESIS as examples of large-scale biomolecular simulations with residue-level CG models. This framework extends accessible spatial and temporal scales by multi-scale simulations to study biologically relevant phenomena, such as genome-scale chromatin folding or phase-separated membrane-less condensations. Author summary Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely used to investigate biological phenomena that are difficult to study only with experiments. Since all-atom MD simulations of large biomolecular complexes are computationally expensive, coarse-grained (CG) models based on different approximations and interaction potentials have been developed so far. There are two practical issues in biological MD simulations with CG models. The first issue is the input file generations of highly heterogeneous systems. In contrast to well-established all-atom models, specific features are introduced in each CG model, making it difficult to generate input data for the systems containing different types of biomolecules. The second issue is how to improve the computational performance in CG MD simulations of heterogeneous biological systems. Here, we introduce a user-friendly toolbox to generate input files of residue-level CG models containing folded and disordered proteins, RNAs, and DNAs using a unified format and optimize the performance of CG MD simulations via efficient parallelization in GENESIS software. Our implementation will serve as a framework to develop novel CG models and investigate various biological phenomena in the cell.", "year": 2021}

There has been a growing interest in developing new approaches and technologies to improve the user experience so that it can be as natural and immersive as possible. In this context, this work aims to introduce a new concept of natural interaction using the upper limbs with the combination of two types of sensors, classified here as Wearable Inertial Measurement Units (WIMUs) and Head-Mounted Depth Cameras (HMDCs). While HMDCs allow precise tracking of the forearm, hand and fingers, their limited field of view restricts the range of the movements. On the other hand, the WIMUs offer more freedom of movement, since they are not based on cameras and computer vision. However, they are not accurate enough to capture the limbs positions and in details the hands motions. Our solution presents a strategy to combine both classes of sensors in order to improve the user experience with a robust natural interface control. To test the solution, a VR game based on the use of the proposed strategy was developed. An study with tests and evaluation was also developed with users and the results show that the proposed solution outperforms the use of the sensors separately, mainly in terms of performance and fun. Although our proposal is focused on VR games, it can also be an important interaction interface for any other VR based application.", "year": 2017}

Despite their rapid development, how to deal with the uncertain environment during human-robot interactions effectively still remains unresolved. The current artificial intelligence (AI) technology does not support robots to fulfil complex tasks without human\u2019s guidance. Thus, teleoperation, which means remotely controlling a robot by a human operator, is indispensable in many scenarios. It is an important and useful tool in research fields. This thesis focuses on the study of designing a user experience (UX) enhanced robot controller, and human-robot interaction interfaces that try providing human operators an immersion perception of teleoperation. Several works have been done to achieve the goal. First, to control a telerobot smoothly, a customised variable gain control method is proposed where the stiffness of the telerobot varies with the muscle activation level extracted from signals collected by the surface electromyograph(sEMG) devices. Second, two main works are conducted to improve the user-friendliness of the interaction interfaces. One is that force feedback is incorporated into the framework providing operators with haptic feedback to remotely manipulate target objects. Given the high cost of force sensor, in this part of work, a haptic force estimation algorithm is proposed where force sensor is no longer needed. The other main work is developing a visual servo control system, where a stereo camera is mounted on the head of a dual arm robots offering operators real-time working situations. In order to compensate the internal and external uncertainties and accurately track the stereo camera\u2019s view angles along planned trajectories, a deterministic learning techniques is utilised, which enables reusing the learnt knowledge before current dynamics changes and thus features increasing the learning efficiency. Third, instead of sending commands to the telerobts by joy-sticks, keyboards or demonstrations, the telerobts are controlled directly by the upper limb motion of the human operator in this thesis. Algorithm that utilised the motion signals from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to captures humans\u2019 upper limb motion is designed. The skeleton of the operator is detected by Kinect V2 and then transformed and mapped into the joint positions of the controlled robot arm. In this way, the upper limb motion signals from the operator is able to act as reference trajectories to the telerobts. A more superior neural networks (NN) based trajectory controller is also designed to track the generated reference trajectory. Fourth, to further enhance the human immersion perception of teleoperation, the virtual reality (VR) technique is incorporated such that the operator can make interaction and adjustment of robots easier and more accurate from a robot\u2019s perspective. Comparative experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme. Tests with human subjects were also carried out for evaluating the interface design.", "year": 2019}

Online laboratories are poised to assume even greater importance for teaching, as the growing availability of distributed learning approaches, high-speed internet access, and ambient and mobile sensors broadens opportunities worldwide for experiencing practical work. My original contribution to knowledge has been to identify \u2013 and differentiate by scientific discipline \u2013 key priorities for the design of more effective online labs as informed by students' perspectives of the technology. This dissertation is motivated by three research questions: (1) Which aspects of online labs determine whether participants perceive them as authentic learning experiences? (2) Which online lab characteristics dictate their suitability for social modes of learning? (3) How can educators use metafunctional elements \u2013 i.e. computer-mediated features impossible to implement in a proximal setting \u2013 to enhance understanding and skill acquisition? Studies of undergraduate cohorts from both distance learning and conventional institutions were carried out, with an initial emphasis on physics and astronomy coursework that was later extended to other scientific fields. A mixed methods approach was adopted, with quantitative data elicited primarily via multi-stage survey instruments and qualitative data derived principally from interviews or focus groups. Statistical and thematic analyses yielded key findings regarding the roles authenticity, sociability and metafunctionality play in the design of successful online labs. For instance, establishing professional relevance and data reliability in online \nlabs appears far more important to achieving authenticity than photorealistic depictions of scientific sites. Moreover, interfaces that students perceive as denying \nthem agency \u2013 including the ability to make genuine mistakes \u2013 lead to shallow engagement and worse outcomes. Students often deem social interaction a defining \naspect of proximal lab work, so missing provisions for synchronous multi-user presence and communication engender feelings of isolation and helplessness in \nonline labs. While mostly sceptical of metafunctional enhancements, students nonetheless repeatedly express a desire for practice with non-ideal scenarios and \nwith the setup and teardown stages of practical work. Incorporating the proposed design principles will better align future online labs with student expectations, thus \ndeepening engagement and securing improved academic outcomes.", "year": 2016}

Youth of families with a low socioeconomic position are less likely to meet the recommended PA guidelines. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are preferred by youth over traditional in-person approaches and are in line with their media preferences. Despite the promise of mHealth interventions in promoting PA, a common challenge is to engage users in the long term or effectively. Earlier reviews highlighted the association of different design features (eg, notifications and rewards) with engagement among adults. However, little is known about which design features are important for increasing engagement among youth. Objective To inform the design process of future mHealth tools, it is important to investigate the design features that can yield effective user engagement. This systematic review aimed to identify which design features are associated with engagement in mHealth PA interventions among youth who were aged between 4 and 18 years. Methods A systematic search was conducted in EBSCOhost (MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, and Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection) and Scopus. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included if they documented design features associated with engagement. Design features and related behavior change techniques and engagement measures were extracted. Study quality was assessed according to the Mixed Method Assessment Tool, and one-third of all screening and data extraction were double coded by a second reviewer. Results Studies (n=21) showed that various features were associated with engagement, such as a clear interface, rewards, multiplayer game mode, social interaction, variety of challenges with personalized difficulty level, self-monitoring, and variety of customization options among others, including self-set goals, personalized feedback, progress, and a narrative. In contrast, various features need to be carefully considered while designing mHealth PA interventions, such as sounds, competition, instructions, notifications, virtual maps, or self-monitoring, facilitated by manual input. In addition, technical functionality can be considered as a prerequisite for engagement. Research addressing youth from low socioeconomic position families is very limited with regard to engagement in mHealth apps. Conclusions Mismatches between different design features in terms of target group, study design, and content translation from behavior change techniques to design features are highlighted and set up in a design guideline and future research agenda.

The mission for the thesis was to take advantage of Axis developed or developing technology to explore the data value in the retail industry and design a data visualization interface. Shopping via online shopping platforms, customers will leave their shopping journey data and the data can be recorded step by step. By analyzing the conversion rate between different web pages, retailers could narrow down problem areas and even locate problems efficiently. Compared with online shopping platforms, traditional retail stores have limitations on data-collecting and data-integrating. Without analyzing sales numbers, it is difficult for retailers to discover any existing problems during a shopping journey and satisfy their customers by optimizing the shopping journey. Thus, I selected IKEA as my thesis's use study after my comprehensive analysis of camera data-collecting advantages and retailer's concentrated shopping journey data. With a series of user research, I selected to visualize customer flow data, which is an important data reference for making sales plans and designing layout by analyzing the relationship between a customers' path and a Product location.

They are used in various domains including human-computer interaction (HCI) and learning transfer. As an example, gaze-based text entry allows interacting with computing systems remotely without touching the interface. They are also used to comprehend the visual behaviors of a pilot searching for information in a cockpit. However, a number of barriers still exists and makes these devices less accurate and difficult to use in daily activities. One of these problems is the shift between the actual and the estimated position of the user\u2019s point-of-regard, which systematically comes from the eye-tracking systems\u2019 accuracy. Following recent advances, there is an increasing interest in affordable systems that have the potential to be more accurate and, researchers are continually investigating novel approaches. \nThis thesis covers different issues of eye movement research. It proposes the use of novel approaches as a step towards overcoming these accuracy issues. More specifically, we introduce novel strategies for detecting mapping functions for gaze estimation and calibration-free gaze interaction. In addition to proposing frameworks and strategies for improving accuracy, new calibration procedures and patterns are also revealed and discussed. In this thesis, we address these issues in three different ways: calibration and mapping functions, Human-computer Interaction using the eyes, visualization and exploration. We present four main contributions. First, we present a new method for calibrating state-of-the-art eye trackers with better accuracy. Second, we present a new gaze-based authentication method which works without any prior calibration, and can be extended to any alphanumeric-based input modality. Third, we present an uncertainty visualization approach. Finally, a method of analyzing eye \nmovements data and aircraft trajectories using a novel brushing technique is proposed.", "year": 2019}

These studies have revealed positive effects of using in-vehicle CUIs on issues such as: cognitive demand/workload, passive task-related fatigue, trust, acceptance and environmental engagement. A nascent set of human-centred design guidelines that have emerged is presented. These are based on the analysis of users' behaviour and the positive benefits observed, and aim to make interactions with an in-vehicle agent interlocutor safe, effective, engaging and enjoyable, while conforming with users' expectations. The guidelines can be used to inform the design of future in-vehicle CUIs or applied experimentally using WoZ methodology, and will be evaluated and refined in ongoing work.", "year": 2019}

At the same time, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), based on the strong foundations of ergonomics, cognitive science and psychology, constitutes a field critical in shaping the development of technology that is usable and useful to all users. In view of the emerging spread of AI in computing systems of everyday use, it is becoming apparent that AI and HCI can mutually benefit from each other in fruitful cooperation. AI technologies such as natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning have already found their way into innovative applications, empowering the development of useful and intuitive interfaces, offering personalization and context awareness, and enhancing the utility of technological systems as well as the providing User Experience. At the same time, AI-empowered systems can offer insights into user behaviour and preferences, and assist in designing and evaluating interactive systems. On the other hand, HCI is critical to developing ethical, trustworthy, and reliable AI technologies. HCI, focusing on the human and their needs, contributes design principles, methods, and tools, for the design and development of AI systems, fosters meaningful AI explainability, and assures a seamless and beneficial collaboration between humans and AI. In this context, the goal of this special issue is to bring together research findings and best practices from academia and industry, highlighting results of joined AI and HCI forces, and demonstrating progress in related topics, open challenges, as well as novel technological solutions, that leverage AI capabilities to address both new and well-known problems. The 16 papers accepted for publication in this Special Issue address important topics such as trust, transparency, explainability, responsible AI, human-AI interaction and teaming, chatbots, health and well-being applications, and evaluation, and introduce a wide variety of perspectives, approaches, methods, and applications, reflecting the rapid growth and evolution of this research area. The issue of trust is addressed in two papers. The first paper, by Choung et al. (2022) analyzes the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Two studies are reported. The first examines the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants, confirming that trust has a significant effect, which operates through perceived usefulness and participants\u2019 attitude toward voice assistants. The second study distinguishes two dimensions of trust, namely human-like trust and functionality trust, and confirms the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Both dimensions of trust share a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact than human-like trust. Overall, the paper offers a multidimensional measure of trust that can be utilized in future studies on trustworthy AI. The second paper, by Herse et al. (2023) investigates trust in the context of human interaction with intelligent agents. An online experiment is presented which examines whether stimulus difficulty and the implementation of agent features, such as user interface and interaction style, influence user perception, trust and decision-making. The results demonstrate that decision changes occur more for hard stimuli, with participants choosing to change their initial decision across all features to follow the agent\u2019s recommendation. Furthermore, agent features can be utilized to mediate user decision-making and trust in-task, though the direction and extent of this influence depend on the implemented feature and difficulty of the task. The results emphasize the complexity of user trust in Human-Agent collaboration. The paper by Nakao et al. (2022) addresses the issue of responsible AI by investigating the fairness of AI models. A design space exploration is proposed that supports not only data scientists but also domain experts to investigate AI fairness. Using loan applications as an example, a series of workshops were held with loan officers and data scientists to elicit their requirements. Such requirements were then instantiated into a UI to support human-in-the-loop fairness investigations, evaluated through a think-aloud user study. This work contributes better designs to investigate an AI model\u2019s fairness\u2014and move closer towards responsible AI. Jiang et al. (2022) in their paper introduce Situation Awareness as a conceptual framework for considering human-AI interaction, and argue that it is an appropriate and valuable theoretical lens through which to decompose and view the interaction as hierarchical layers that allow for closer inquiry and discovery. Furthermore, they illustrate why the Situation Awareness perspective is particularly relevant to the current need to understand Human-Centered AI by identifying tensions inherent in AI design and explaining how Situation Awareness may help alleviate these tensions. Users\u2019 enactment of Situation Awareness has the potential to mitigate some negative impacts of AI systems on user experience, improve human agency during AI system use, and promote more efficient and effective decision-making.", "year": 2023}

However, attendance in these programs is low. Travel-related PA (TPA) monitoring via a smartphone app can provide an opportunity to assess the part of routine PA level. A digital framework consisting of a smartphone app to monitor travel behaviour and a semi-automated feedback report to show the performance of TPA was used in a pilot trial. An important component of this digital framework is a web-based visualization dashboard designed for healthcare providers to get insights into the routine TPA performance of their patients. This study aims to describe the design process and design evaluation of healthcare providers for the visualization dashboard. After designing the user interface screens of the dashboard, the prospective healthcare providers were contacted from the four hospitals in Belgium. Seven interested representative participants attended a focus group session. The session's proceedings were recorded and transcribed. A directed content analysis was used which utilizes a predetermined coding scheme. The usability of the web-based visualization dashboard's content (monitoring and enhancing TPA) was evaluated as of significant importance within and after the rehabilitation programs in the secondary prevention of CHD. TPA monitoring can be effective in motivating targeted patients who have sedentary lifestyles and do not attend rehabilitation programs. Experts particularly recommended adopting engagement strategies for the TPA monitoring and enhancing frameworks. The strategies to enhance patient engagement should be given high importance in future intervention design.", "year": 2022}

However, many carers report feeling disempowered and ill-equipped to support patients. Our group published evidence-based guidelines (the Triadic Oncology [TRIO] Guidelines) to improve oncology clinician engagement with carers and the management of challenging situations involving carers.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo facilitate implementation of the TRIO Guidelines in clinical practice, we aimed to develop, iteratively refine, and conduct user testing of a suite of evidence-based and interactive web-based education modules for oncology clinicians (e-Triadic Oncology [eTRIO]), patients with cancer, and carers (eTRIO for Patients and Carers [eTRIO-pc]). These were designed to improve carer involvement, communication, and shared decision-making in the cancer management setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe eTRIO education modules were based on extensive research, including systematic reviews, qualitative interviews, and consultation analyses. Guided by the person-based approach, module content and design were reviewed by an expert advisory group comprising academic and clinical experts (n=13) and consumers (n=5); content and design were continuously and iteratively refined. User experience testing (including \"think-aloud\" interviews and administration of the System Usability Scale [SUS]) of the modules was completed by additional clinicians (n=5), patients (n=3), and carers (n=3).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe final clinician module comprises 14 sections, requires approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to complete, and covers topics such as carer-inclusive communication and practices; supporting carer needs; and managing carer dominance, anger, and conflicting patient-carer wishes. The usability of the module was rated by 5 clinicians, with a mean SUS score of 75 (SD 5.3), which is interpreted as good. Clinicians often desired information in a concise format, divided into small \"snackable\" sections that could be easily recommenced if they were interrupted. The carer module features 11 sections; requires approximately 1.5 hours to complete; and includes topics such as the importance of carers, carer roles during consultations, and advocating for the patient. The patient module is an adaptation of the relevant carer module sections, comprising 7 sections and requiring 1 hour to complete. The average SUS score as rated by 6 patients and carers was 78 (SD 16.2), which is interpreted as good. Interactive activities, clinical vignette videos, and reflective learning exercises are incorporated into all modules. Patient and carer consumer advisers advocated for empathetic content and tone throughout their modules, with an easy-to-read and navigable module interface.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe eTRIO suite of modules were rigorously developed using a person-based design methodology to meet the unique information needs and learning requirements of clinicians, patients, and carers, with the goal of improving effective and supportive carer involvement in cancer consultations and cancer care.", "year": 2023}

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of enhancing SSVEP -based BCI applications by incorporating the user\u2019s emotions. To this end, an SSVEP-based BCI application is designed and implemented where the user has to steer a simulated car moving through a maze to reach a target position. Using standard flickering checkerboards, the user has to select one of two commands, turn right or turn left. After each selection, a visual virtual feedback is shown and the emotional state of the user is estimated from recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) brain activities. This estimated emotion could be used to automatically confirm or cancel the selected command and therefore improve the quality of executed commands.", "year": 2017}

Due to various health conditions, they are often unable to use standard joystick interface, most of wheelchairs are equipped with. To accommodate this audience, a number of alternative human-machine interfaces have been designed, such as single switch, sip-and-puff, brain-computer interfaces. They are known as low throughput interfaces referring to the amount of information that an operator can pass into the machine. Using them to control a wheelchair poses a number of challenges. This thesis makes several contributions towards the design of robotic wheelchairs controlled via low throughput human-machine interfaces: (1) To improve wheelchair motion control, an adaptive controller with online parameter estimation is developed for a differentially driven wheelchair. (2) Steering control scheme is designed that provides a unified framework integrating different types of low throughput human-machine interfaces with an obstacle avoidance mechanism. (3) A novel approach to the design of control systems with low throughput human-machine interfaces has been proposed. Based on the approach, position control scheme for a holonomic robot that aims to probabilistically minimize time to destination is developed and tested in simulation. The scheme is adopted for a real differentially driven wheelchair. In contrast to other methods, the proposed scheme allows to use prior information about the user habits, but does not restrict navigation to a set of pre-defined points, and parallelizes the inference and motion reducing the navigation time. (4) To enable the real time operation of the position control, a high-performance algorithm for single-source any-angle path planning on a grid has been developed. By abandoning the graph model and introducing discrete geometric primitives to represent the propagating wave front, we were able to design a planning algorithm that uses only integer addition and bit shifting. Experiments revealed a significant performance advantage. Several modifications, including optimal and multithreaded implementations, are also presented.

Unfortunately, efficient and effective review of these data is impeded by the varied format, location, and workflow of data acquisition, storage, and processing in the electronic health record. While machine learning and clinical decision support tools are well-positioned as potential solutions, the translation of such frameworks requires that barriers to implementation be addressed in the formative research stages. Transparency, accountability, suitability, and adaptability may be bolstered by clinician engagement through a direct empathetic approach aimed at determining complex user requirements of implementation, usability, and workflow integration. Objectives: We aimed to utilize a structured user-centered design approach (double-diamond design framework) to 1) qualitatively explore clinicians' experience with the current asthma management system, 2) identify user requirements to improve algorithm explainability and A-GPS prototype, and 3) identify potential barriers to ML-based CDS system use. Methods: At the 'discovery' phase, we first shadowed to understand the practice context. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted online with 14 clinicians who provide asthma care at two outpatient facilities. Participants were asked about their current difficulties in gathering information for pediatric asthma patients, their expectations of ideal workflows and tools, and suggestions on user-centered interfaces and features. At the 'define' phase, a synthesis analysis was conducted to converge key results from interviewees' insights into themes, eventually forming critical 'how might we' research questions to guide model development and implementation. Results: We identified user requirements and potential barriers associated with three overarching themes: 1) Usability and Workflow Aspects of the ML System, 2) User Expectations and Algorithm Explainability, and 3) Barriers to Implementation in Context. Even though the responsibilities and workflows vary among different roles, the core asthma-related information and functions they requested were highly cohesive, which allows for a shared information view of the tool. Clinicians hope to perceive the usability of the model with the ability to note patients' high risks and take proactive actions to manage asthma efficiently and effectively. For optimal machine-learning algorithm explainability, requirements included documentation to support the validity of algorithm development and output logic, and a request for increased transparency to build trust and validate how the algorithm arrived at the decision. Acceptability, adoption, and sustainability of the asthma management tool are implementation outcomes that are reliant on the proper design and training as suggested by participants. Conclusions: As part of our comprehensive informatics-based process centered on clinical usability, we approach the problem using a theoretical framework grounded in user experience research leveraging semi-structured interviews. Our focus on meeting the needs of the practice with machine learning technology is emphasized by a user-centered approach to clinician engagement through upstream technology design.", "year": 2022}

Hence, differentiating their marketing techniques has become essential for businesses. One way to do this is to use guerrilla marketing, a more intense, creative and attention-capturing marketing technique which is more effective than traditional marketing. The purpose of this write-up is to explore the types guerrilla marketing techniques used by various organization and elaborating the strategies used in these techniques. The study examines the guerrilla marketing strategy as an important, creative, and a low-cost alternative achieved at a fraction of the cost of general marketing techniques. It introduces Guerrilla marketing strategy; definition, principles, benefits and their role in enriching the brand's aesthetic and functional values. Introduction: Companies are continually attempting to find out the best way to get the highest quantity of client\u2019s attention in this age of contemporary marketing. The basics are evident: In order to boost sales, you need to persuade clients to purchase certain goods or services with the assistance of efficient advertising. It must be visible in order to make your advertisement efficient. And while this sounds so easy\u2013we live in an age in which we are over-exposed to unnecessary quantities of unimaginative, sometimes worrying, advertisements \u2013online, on TV, or in print. This implies that bringing an ad with a favourable message to the masses is becoming difficult for marketers, while remaining convincing. This precise dilemma resulted in creation of guerrilla marketing over the period of 30 years. (Amy, 2011) Objectives of the Study: \uf0b7 Various strategies used by the organisations. \uf0b7 Effectiveness of the initiatives. \uf0b7 Reaction of target audience groups towards the initiative. \uf0b7 Overall achievement of the initiative and general outcome. Need for the study: Consumers today are spoilt with choice with multiple brands fighting together to get the desired attention, hence marketeers are forced to innovate and give their products a more distinctive edge. Guerrilla marketing tactics are used in order to arouse interest and create a buzz towards the intended brand, which in turn creates element of surprise as well as unique experiences for the target consumers. This study also aims to throw light on the various aspects of guerrilla marketing strategies such as: \uf0b7 More emphasis is laid on human psychology. Experience, judgment, and guesswork are secondary. \u00a9 2019 JETIR July 2019, Volume 6, Issue 7 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIR1907855 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 694 \uf0b7 The major investments are time, energy, and imagination, instead of money. \uf0b7 Instead of getting new customers more emphasis is laid on getting more referrals, more transactions with existing customers, and larger transactions. \uf0b7 Multiple combination of marketing methods is generally used for a specific campaign. \uf0b7 Current technologies are used as tool for empowerment of a business. What is Guerrilla Marketing: The word originated from the Spanish word \u2018la guerra\u2019 which means war. Which in turn means a type of surprise underground warfare strategy in which the primary aim is to disrupt the focus of the enemy and defeating them. The term was introduced by the American Marketing Guru Jay Conrad Levinson in his book of the same title in 1984. During 60\u2019s the medium for mass advertising for most of the companies was limited to radio and prints. Late 80\u2019s to early 90\u2019s witnessed the introduction of the new cable television for advertisements. In order to attract the attention of the customers even more new tactics were being developed by marketers for reaping maximum benefits out of a shoestring budget. Generally, the uniqueness of Guerrilla marketing is ample usage of shock, outrageousness, and clever techniques. Which results in creating a high impact and memorable experience for the consumers. The three U\u2019s that form core of successful guerrilla marketing are \uf0b7 Unexpected \uf0b7 Unconventional \uf0b7 Underground (KENTON, 2018) The Various types under which guerrilla market can be classified are: Ambient marketing Here brand recognition is created by a business without unnecessary pushing of the product. Example \u201cHelp me read initiative\u201d (India) The non profit organisation \u2018Children of the world\u2019 which is based in India came up with a unique solution of creating awareness about \u2018help me read\u2019 initiative regarding fund raising for the under-privileged children. Who can\u2019t afford to pursue education and have left school to earn, for supporting their families. These children themselves were selling the magazines which was used as a medium to raise funds. The magazine contained a stamped envelope with a message on the cover \u201cHELP ME READ THIS\u201d. And all the information regarding how to contribute was inside the envelop. Result: this campaign resulted in enquires and donation from over three hundred individuals who also volunteered to help the children read and write. The donation was used to set up a school in the city. \u00a9 2019 JETIR July 2019, Volume 6, Issue 7 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIR1907855 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 695 Fig-1 Children selling books Presence marketing This type of marketing is about making the business name recognisable and familiar by being visible daily. Example: Nokia created the world's largest interactive signpost in London with the aim of raising awareness of Nokia GPS (global positing system). With this marketing effort, the consumer can type in recommendation anywhere in the world for their choice of local attraction. The destination was displayed on the huge sign with full data about the destination and distance in kilometres to the designated place after submission. In London and the neighbouring market, this stunt helped create a monstrous effect. Illustrating the use of social media as well as the consumer's ability to generate a lifetime experience from the brand. This also created general awareness regarding how it is like to own Nokia GPS. (SEVERN, 2012) Fig-2 Nokia GPS Signboard Grassroot marketing Rather than a getting customers on large scale this type of marketing is about winning customer on singular bases. Grass root marketing\u2019s success relies on highlighting both private relationships and individual relationships. Example: World Wildlife Fund works towards conservation in over 100 countries and supported by 5 million members globally. They initiated this campaign where the younger audience would be made aware of the endangered animals by using endangered emojis while using twitter, 17 endangered animals were turned into adorable emojis character and every time user twitted one they also pledged to make 10 cent donation that would be contributed at the end of the month which the user will pay voluntarily, within a year emojis had been used over 202 million times on twitter.

This may include paper, posters, magnets stickers and vinyl labels. Possible places can be building, cafes, walkways, lamppost etc. Example: These tactics which is in the form of posters or bill board as well as in the form of pop-up advertisement on internet. The posters or billboards are placed in large number in multiple locations primarily in dense urban areas to attract maximum attention of the consumer. It is inexpensive form of advertising which offers high degree of exposure especially useful in the entertainment industry (album, consorts). \u00a9 2019 JETIR July 2019, Volume 6, Issue 7 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIR1907855 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 697 Fig-4 Wild Posting Billboards Under cover/ buzz marketing This is one of the undercover as well as a creative way for someone to market or pitch about an item where the customers have no idea that they've just experienced a sales pitch. Example: This is about a film \u201cThe Blair witch project \u201ccreated by 5 students fresh from film school.

This article follows the principle and method of system engineering for summary design and lay the foundation for system development. Design process based on the summary design strategy, mainly completed the system architecture design and system functional design. Architecture design adopts three layer structure, the presentation layer directly interact with the user, the business layer is used to handle user input information, data layer definition and maintain data integrity and security; Functional design using modular method, designed by the Web page, course management, system utilities, rights management, basic information and query statements such as module and its logical structure of sub modules. Introduction Office is the most important and the most onerous position, is also the most can reflect the characteristics of school teaching departments, colleges and universities teaching affairs management level directly reflects the overall teaching level. Traditional way of artificial management there are a lot of repeated labor, low productivity, information update disadvantages such as not in time, can't meet the need of the development of the information age, unable to meet the needs of modern teaching management. Therefore, around the content and goals of teaching affairs, on the basis of learning teaching plan, integration of educational administration process, reasonable use of existing resources, develop a modern educational administration information management system, can effectively solve the plight of educational administration work, improve the level of teaching management. Development of university educational administration management system, to realize information sharing within the scope of the whole school teaching, the teachers and students through the network for teaching information and resources, for the majority of teachers and students to provide quality and efficient teaching environment and good service guarantee. At the same time, the existing hardware and software resources and data to effectively integrate resources, change the traditional way of office, for building interconnectivity, efficient Shared, unified management of the digital platform foundation. Summary design is designed according to user interaction process and user needs to create the interaction framework and visual framework of process, the result is often to reflect the interaction controls the overall layout, interface elements grouping and interface board type to present in the form of a page frame. Summary design and requirements analysis is the process of the production function model, data model and behavior model analysis conclusion, the conclusions of the resulting design process. In the transformation process from analysis to design, summary design to produce the relevant software system architecture, software architecture and data structure design model. These conclusions will be written into the general design document, the late as the basic foundation of detailed design, and to provide technical solution for the detailed design and program code. Curriculum management is an important educational administration work, involving curriculum and performance management aspects of problem, is one of the most complex work in the educational administration [1,2]. Curriculum management system is an important component of the comprehensive educational administration system, this paper carries on the summary design, foundation for later the detailed design and software implementation. 5th International Conference on Social Science, Education and Humanities Research (SSEHR 2016) \u00a9 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 660 Summary Design Strategy Structured design is a method of top-down, decompose step by step, through the module chart to represent the logical structure of the software. Module is a certain function, can be individually named accessed data and a collection of program statements. In combination with the ideas and methods of software engineering, using structured approaches for software summary design should follow the following strategies: (1) Module has a relatively independent [3]. Module independence refers to each module in the software system has the function of single and don't have much contact with other module. Each module in the software system, namely, only the software requirements of a particular function, and other modules in the software system interface is simple, to reduce unnecessary data cross, calls and control. (2) The module partition should facilitate system implemented in stages. Every stage of life cycle of the software development process based on the activities of the division, on the basis of user requirements can be converted to the software system the process of collection activities. According to the theory of the life cycle of software engineering, software development is a complicated system engineering, the development process is typically in stages, module partition should consider the request. (3) Reduce the module interface complexity and redundancy. Complex is a software module interface error, a main reason of the module interface should be as simple as possible and is consistent with the module function. Interface complex or inconsistent (i.e., there has been no contact between transfer of data) and characterization of high coupling and low cohesion, to analyze the independence of the module. (4) Modules can be predicted. Module function constant predictable refers to input, output constant, should also be based on the input data to predict the output. In addition, if the design of the local data structure of the module, the control process and other factors, such as external interface limit too much, to remove these restrictions will increase maintenance costs later. System Architecture Design With the continuous progress of software engineering and specifications, and the application of object-oriented programming ideas, people, extension of encapsulation, reuse and displacement and so on demand more and more, make double layer architecture more bloated trival, three-tier application architecture system arises at the historic moment. Three layer architecture architecture is inevitable outcome in the development of object-oriented thought. The three-tier architecture, is between client/server joined a \"middle tier\", also called component layer, together with the client and the server layer constitutes the three layers system [4]. From the development and application perspective, the three layer architecture than double or single structure has a greater advantage. Three layer structure is suitable for community development, each person can have different division of labor, to work together on doubling efficiency. Double or single application, every developer response system have deeper understanding, ability request is very high, three layer application, can be combined with various talents, only a few people on the system overall understanding, reduce the difficulty of development. Combining with the characteristics of curriculum management system design of three layer architecture is shown in Fig. 1. (1) Presentation Layer: directly interact with the user, and responsible response to the user's request, generally refers to the system interface, used for data entry and data display, etc. The presentation layer of this system is mainly for \"would secretary, would management, Course the teacher and Students in school, Other personnel\" five types such as user provide operational services. Between the presentation layer and business layer through \"Data exchange interface\". (2) Business Layer. It\u2019s between the presentation Layer and data Layer, responsible for handling user input information or to save the information sent to the data Layer, or Layer through data from the database read these data [5]. This layer can include some code for \"business logic\" to describe. The business layer is the bridge between the presentation layer and data layer, is responsible for", "year": 2016}

In particular, in the used car market, consumers encounter such problems as: a car in a poorer condition than initially indicated, accident damage that was not previously disclosed, little or no documentation provided, and fraud. Nobel prize winner G.A. Akerlof described the market for used cars as an example of the problem of information asymmetries and resulting quality uncertainty (Akerlof 1970). In my dissertation, I look at how an application on top of blockchain technology, which is claimed to bring trust by design due to its inherent characteristics, may be designed as a novel solution to resolve problems in the \u2018Market for Lemons\u2019 and, thus, enhance trust between buyers and sellers. While there may be some genuine trust in blockchain technology itself, on an application level, trust in an IT artifact needs to be established. This need for trust establishment is at heart of this dissertation project. This cumulative dissertation is structured in three parts. \nIn part I, I explore the characteristics of blockchain platforms and relevant aspects for their design (i.e., the data quality aspect and token design). In part II, I propose a design to address problems associated with a of lack of trust, caused by information asymmetries, between car buyers and car sellers with the help of an IT artifact: a blockchain-based cardossier. The cardossier application reflects a car\u2019s history over its whole lifecycle (from production to utilization). The proposed design relates to the end-user-facing frontend application. In this part, I focus on the problems and needs of used car buyers, the requirements placed for the design of the application, the actual elements of the application design, and the effects of the application\u2019s usage in the \u2018Market for Lemons\u2019. The results show that the problems buyers experience are a paradox of having a large variety of information sources available about brands, and the quality characteristics and performance of certain models; while information about a specific car is not transparent and often even hidden. Though providing more information about a used car leads to fewer information asymmetries in general, advanced information elements are beneficial in improving the situation further. As for trust, such a system enhances trust between buyers and sellers and, in general, makes the overall purchase process more trustworthy. However, to achieve these positive effects, the quality of the stored information should be guaranteed and properly communicated to the end-user. Additionally, exploring the use of the cardossier, embedded into an online used car sales platform, several groups of factors (technology-related, data-related, design-related, user-related) that play an important role in trust formation were revealed. Furthermore, through adopting the perspective of technology affordances, we identified blockchain platform affordances related to the trust in a blockchain platform. \nIn part III, the transfer of a research project into practice, preparation for market entry, associated tensions the blockchain consortium had to face while implementing the platform are discussed along three themes: consortium management, business value, and governance. \nAltogether, the three parts of the dissertation provide better understanding of blockchain platforms, applications built on top of them and their usage in the \u2018Market for Lemons\u2019. Thus, this dissertation contributes to the body of knowledge on trust design in the context of blockchain technology and applications on top of it, and also to the broader literature on examining the \u2018Market for Lemons\u2019 and solutions to its problems. As blockchain applications are still being developed, and as we are just beginning to understand the potential of the blockchain technology, such research has scientific value in terms of design and organizational implications.", "year": 2020}

As access to the internet and social media continues to increase, so will this type of online health information seeking behavior, placing social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook in a unique position to facilitate health communication and improve access to health information. While improved access to health information has the capacity to benefit the individual, online health information is not without risk, with quality and accuracy often a point of concern. The dissemination of misinformation has the potential to do harm by misleading decision making or encouraging harmful health practices. With this risk\u2013benefit balance in mind, this study seeks to gain a better understanding of what types of ovarian cancer information are exchanged over social media, while exploring how this information is shared. This knowledge may be used to inform health communication practices, providing insight into how social media can be used to disseminate quality, and timely, information about ovarian cancer prevention. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Using an infodemiological approach, we will collect tweets via a topic specific Twitter streaming Application Programming Interface (API), over a period of two to four weeks. Prior research suggests that this time frame will result in the collection of 500 to 2,000 tweets. Tweet selection will be based on a series of keywords related to ovarian cancer and ovarian cancer prevention. The resulting data will be compiled into a tweets corpus, and a random selection of tweets will be pulled from this corpus for further analysis. From there, we will perform a content analysis of the tweets, examining how ovarian cancer is mentioned, what, if any, information is being requested or provided via the tweet, while noting engagement (e.g. likes, shares, etc.). Finally, we will assess any use of imagery, graphics, videos, hashtags, calls to action, or external links. Publically available demographic information (including age, gender and ethnicity) will be noted, while maintaining user anonymity. We will use Pearson Chi\u2013squared test to test for associations between the types of content, engagement, and demographic data. SUMMARY OF DATA: Based on early data, we expect to see the public using Twitter frequently to share a variety of resources related to ovarian cancer prevention, including articles about health behaviors related to ovarian cancer risk, references to personal experience, and discussion of genetic test results. We anticipate that Tweets receiving high engagement will continue to feature graphics, trending hashtags, and a call to action, inviting user interaction. Early data also suggests that the quality and accuracy of health information shared over Twitter is inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Early data reveals that Twitter is a fast, cost\u2013effective, and customizable source for data collection, unveiling online health information seeking behaviors and associated health communication efforts. While there are lingering concerns regarding how keyword identification may impact data collection efforts, social media platforms like Twitter provide a novel opportunity to assess, and facilitate, the exchange of ovarian cancer information, particularly among Millennials. Given the potential reach of online health information via social media, alongside the suspect quality of many shared sources, further research is needed to learn more about guiding information consumption toward quality sources.

In various fields such as medicine, education, or business, gamification has been explored as an efficient vehicle to foster real-life predetermined targets or improve a real-life action's effectiveness. Amidst the current energy transition, gamification has emerged as a promising strategy to make the energy transition exciting to end-users, bridging information gaps, increasing learning, and motivating behaviour change. This study presents the design and development of a gamified solution as part of the Smart2B H2020 project. The primary objective is to create an excellent user-engagement experience while encouraging and fostering energy literacy and behaviour change. Leveraging the increasing digitalization of the energy sector, the developed gamified module will feature a user interface (UI) tool that promotes healthy competition between users, primarily driven by changes in energy consumption behaviour. The monthly and overall leader boards will translate energy savings into an in-game virtual point-based system, reinforcing the intrinsic value of energy conservation. The gamified elements and mechanisms, such as missions, interactive tasks or challenges, instant feedback, achievements, and badges, will progressively guide users in understanding their energy consumption patterns and how they can be improved. Drawing from social engineering and educational perspectives, the pilot sites within the Smart2B project will maximize user interaction and engagement to motivate real behaviour change.

ARTHA TELEKOMINDO", "abstract": "Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a term that has become increasingly popular in recent years. Coupled with the development of information technology is increasingly penetrated a variety of business applications. CRM is a strategy and an effort to build relationships with customers and provide satisfactory service for customers. By leveraging CRM, companies will know what their customers expect and need. Thus customer loyalty can be maintained and not easily move to another brand. CRM supports a company to provide customer service and establish relationships with every valuable customer through the use of customer information. Based on what is known from customers, companies can make variations of offers, services, programs. Through a CRM system, companies establish closer relationships with customers, where companies can identify customers' needs and provide a choice of products or services that meet their demands. CRM is defined as an integration of sales strategy, and coordinated service. CRM stores all customer information that works for each department requiring information about that customer. CRM's success requires not only the quality or the technological system, but also the need for effective service concepts as well as the appropriate operating procedures. Thus, the successful implementation of CRM relies on active employee engagement within the organization itself. In this CRM system, the authors use the Prototyping methodology. Prototyping serves as a mechanism to identify software requirements. Prototypes begin with communication, meet with end users to define overall goals for software, identify what requirements are required, and outline areas as well as define further are mandatory. Design focuses on representation of software aspects that will be visible to the end user (eg, interface layout or output display format). The prototype is deployed and evaluated by the end user, which responds and is used for revision requirements. \n \nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) menjadi istilah yang pada beberapa tahun terakhir semakin populer.

Berdasarkan apa yang diketahui dari pelanggan, perusahaan dapat membuat variasi penawaran, pelayanan, program. Melalui sistem yang menerapkan CRM, perusahaan membentuk hubungan yang lebih dekat dengan pelanggan, dimana perusahaan dapat mengetahui kebutuhan pelanggan dan menyediakan pilihan produk atau layanan yang sesuai dengan permintaan mereka. CRM didefinisikan sebagai integrasi dari strategi penjualan, dan pelayanan yang terkoordinasi. CRM menyimpan seluruh informasi pelanggan yang berfungsi untuk masing-masing departemen yang memerlukan informasi tentang pelanggan tersebut. Kesuksesan CRM tidak hanya membutuhkan kualitas atau sistem teknologi, namun juga membutuhkan konsep layanan yang efektif pula sebagai prosedur operasional yang sesuai.

The PRIDE software was developed to author and execute electronic procedures for NASA spacecraft and habitat operations. We describe our approach for modeling human-automation work based on a procedure language, and allocating and execution tasks among a human-automation team. We illustrate our approach with examples of collaborative work using procedure automation. Procedure Automation for NASA The PRIDE software was developed to author and execute electronic procedures for NASA spacecraft and habitat operations. The nature of work in NASA operations requires specialized knowledge about complex systems that may be used infrequently. Additionally, error consequences when performing the job can be significant. NASA uses procedures as a means of \u201cplanning ahead\u201d how operators will perform both nominal and off-nominal work, to mitigate the risks of operating in such a high criticality domain. Procedures are used to manage spacecraft and habitat systems, perform Extra Vehicular Activities (EVAs), and conduct space science and exploration. Astronauts and flight controllers are trained using procedures. Qualifying for flight control positions includes performance using procedures. Thus, NASA users are familiar with procedures and procedures are well-maintained. NASA is interested is the use of procedures as the basis of task automation. As astronauts move deeper into space, their workload is expected to increase because Earth-based flight controllers will not be in continuous real-time communication. Task automation has potential to reduce astronaut workload for such missions. It also can improve response time as communication latency with Earth increases. And automation can prove beneficial in performing tasks prone to human error, such as vigilance monitoring. One challenge in automating procedures is capturing procedure knowledge that can be used both for manual and Copyright \u00a9 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. automated execution. These task models often are built when the manual procedure is first documented, and well before the automation is available. Thus, our approach must produce electronic procedures for either manual or automated execution. NASA procedure authors are subject matter experts, so we also need an approach to task modeling that does not require computer programming skills. Another challenge in automating procedures is communicating automation behavior and its effects on spacecraft and habitat systems. The introduction of task automation into NASA operations requires establishing operator trust that automation is reliable and predictable. Even when operating at a high level of automation, it is expected that operators must maintain awareness of automation actions, because they are responsible to direct and manage automation. It also is expected that operators will intervene when automation or system behavior is different than expected. The PRIDE electronic procedure software was developed to address these challenges. It consists of a procedure editor (Pride Author), web-based display server (Pride View), and an automation engine (PAX). We describe our approach for modeling human-automation work based on a procedure language, and allocating and executing tasks among a human-automation team. We illustrate our approach with examples of collaborative work using procedure automation. We summarize our studies of performance with procedure automation. We propose to present our position with demonstration at the workshop. Modeling Human Work for Automation Inspection of the procedures used by NASA human space flight reveals an underlying action vocabulary and grammar for using this vocabulary that has a clearly defined semantics. When managing spacecraft or habitats, operators need to perform actions such as 1) send commands to a system 2) verify sensed values are as expected 3) record sensed values at a specific point in the procedure, and 4) wait for a sensed value to reach a target value. These atomic actions are composed into checklists with conditional action sequencing, such as 1) performing a subset of actions conditional upon situated information, and 2) looping through a subset of actions until a condition is true. PRIDE task models are represented using a procedure representation language (PRL; Kortenkamp, et al., 2008) that abstracts this vocabulary in a set of instruction types for building the action sequences seen in procedure checklists. One user of PRIDE procedures is the procedure author who creates and modifies the PRL. For NASA, procedure authors are subject matter experts. They usually are engineers, scientists, or mathematicians. While they understand how to use a computer, they often have no background in computer programming. They typically use Microsoft Word to author procedure documents that are translated into XML files by a programmer. The Pride Author software provides a way for authors to produce XML directly while manipulating instruction objects (Izygon, et al 2008). To add an instruction, the author drags the desired instruction type (corresponding to an action) into a central canvas area. This produces an instance of that type. Manipulation of these instruction objects in the canvas automatically produces PRL in the background. What the author sees is an action-object pair similar to what they typed into the Word document e.g., a valve enable command is displayed \u201cCmd CO2 Vent Valve Enable\u201d. The author also drags items from a model of the system commands and data (called the System Representation; Bell, et al., 2015) to insert references to system commands and telemetry verifies. Figure 1 shows an example of the procedure editing user interface for building PRL procedures. When executing the procedure, both the operator and automation use the same PRL task model to perform tasks. This model combines information to instruct a person what actions to take with information needed to execute those actions. Thus, a task to compare a sensed instrument reading to a target value will include both operator directions for what values to compare and data references for accessing current sensed readings. This model is used to generate a web user interface of the procedure document that is directly manipulated by a person to perform the task. The same model is used by the software to automate tasks. As the procedure instructions are executed, the procedure display is annotated with information about the state of execution (what has been done, what remains to be done); see Figure 2. The same annotations are used whether a person or automation performs the task. Thus, the same task-based user interface is used to monitor the actions of automation as is used to perform actions manually. This shared task model is the basis of humanautomation communication about the task. Structuring the work of automation according to human work improves the transparency of automation actions. This approach provides a means for establishing common ground about the ongoing task that should improve operator understanding of automation behavior (Clark and Brennan, 1991). Sharing Task Responsibility with Automation Shared human-automation work for complex, high risk domains benefits from the ability to tailor the task allocations to the situation. For example, workload balancing may require a redistribution of tasks among the humanautomation team. For electronic procedures, this means shifting or sharing the responsibility to perform instructions or make decisions between operators and automation. Each instruction is designated as manual only or automatable. Manual only instructions can only be performed by a person. Automatable instructions can be performed either by automation or a person. For the domains in which PRIDE procedures have been used, the ability to designate an instruction as Automated Only has not been needed. These designations are made when the procedure is auFigure 1. Pride Author User Interface Figure 2. Pride View User Interface thored, and can be adjusted as needed when a procedure is performed (Schreckenghost, et al., 2008). Responsibility to complete an instruction can be shared by the operator and automation. Instructions have an optional Witness property indicating when a person should approve the action taken by automation before proceeding to the next instruction. Failure of a human witness to approve the instruction is considered anomalous execution. Procedure instructions are designed to be executed in the order shown in the procedure. When performing instructions manually, however, the user is able to alter the order of execution. PRIDE provides functionality (oversight mode) to alert the user when doing an instruction out of order, but such re-ordering is not prevented. When performing instructions automatically, the order of execution is enforced by the automation (guided mode). The currently \u201cactive\u201d instruction is indicated by a colored, labeled focus bar placed behind the instruction. The operator can only manipulate command buttons or other interaction forms in the active instruction; all other instructions are disabled for manipulation until the focus bar reaches them. Procedures can be composed of a mix of Manual Only and Automatable instructions. When operating in guided mode, the automation will pause when it reaches a Manual Only instruction. The interaction forms for that instruction are enabled for manipulation. If the user completes the manual action, the focus bar moves to the next instruction and automation resumes, if the instruction is designated Automatable. The user also has the option to skip the instruction, fail the instruction, or stop automation. Examples of Collaboration with Automation Multiple procedures can execute concurrently, operating at different levels of automation and with different type", "year": 2018}

Startups are often starting or growing businesses that have recently been started and are synonymous with technology. However, the level of achievement of startups in Indonesia is still low. The failure of a startup is caused by a managerial factor such as lack of experience and a clear vision from the founders of the company, lack of company focus in running the business or running out of funds, and other factors like the absence of market needs (no market need).

Wireless headsets and improved tracking systems allow us to easily navigate real and virtual environments by walking. In spite of the benefits, walking brings challenges to the design of new systems. In particular, designers must be aware of cognitive and motor requirements so that walking does not negatively impact the main task. Unfortunately, those demands are not yet fully understood. In this dissertation, we present new scientific evidence, interaction designs, and analysis of the role of walking in different mixed reality applications. We evaluated the difference in performance of users walking vs. manipulating a dataset during visual analysis. This is an important task, since virtual reality is increasingly being used as a way to make sense of progressively complex datasets. Our findings indicate that neither option is absolutely better: the optimal design choice should consider both user\u2019s experience with controllers and user\u2019s inherent spatial ability. Participants with reasonable game experience and low spatial ability performed better using the manipulation technique. However, we found that walking can still enable higher performance for participants with low spatial ability and without significant game experience. In augmented reality, specifying points in space is an essential step to create content that is registered with the world. However, this task can be challenging when information about the depth or geometry of the target is not available. We evaluated different augmented reality techniques for point marking that do not rely on any model of the environment. We found that triangulation by physically walking between points provides higher accuracy than purely perceptual methods. However, precision may be affected by head pointing tremors. To increase the precision, we designed a new technique that uses multiple samples to obtain a better estimate of the target position. This technique can also be used to mark points while walking. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated with a controlled augmented reality simulation and actual outdoor tests. Moving into the future, augmented reality will eventually replace our mobile devices as the main method of accessing information. Nonetheless, to achieve its full potential, augmented reality interfaces must support the fluid way we move in the world. We investigated the potential of adaptation in achieving this goal. We conceived and implemented an adaptive workspace system, based in the study of the design space and through user contextual studies. Our final design consists in a minimum set of techniques to support mobility and integration with the real world. We also identified a set of key interaction patterns and desirable properties of adaptation-based techniques, which can be used to guide the design of the next-generation walking-centered workspaces. Walk-Centric User Interfaces for Mixed Reality Wallace Santos Lages GENERAL AUDIENCE ABSTRACT Until recently, walking with virtual and augmented reality headsets was restricted by issues such as excessive weight, cables, tracking limitations, etc. As those limits go away, walking is becoming more common, making the user experience closer to the real world. If well explored, walking can also make some tasks easier and more efficient. Unfortunately, walking reduces our mental and motor performance and its consequences in interface design are not fully understood. In this dissertation, we present studies of the role of walking in three areas: scientific visualization in virtual reality, marking points in augmented reality, and accessing information in augmented reality. We show that although walking reduces our ability to perform those tasks, careful design can reduce its impact in a meaningful way.", "year": 2018}

The 5 kHz linerate scanning is more than three orders of magnitude faster than typical AFM instruments. Highprecision electronics and enhanced accuracy of positioning sensors enable closed-loop sample scanning on all three axes. These factors contribute to reduction of drift, enable routine observation of atomic defects, and reach resolution at sub-molecular levels. Surveying molecular events with a temporal resolution of 20 ms is possible with an 8 MHz bandwidth detector. Scan speed limitations were reduced using high-bandwidth processing electronics, a custom high-speed power amplifier, and advanced algorithms for scanner control and feedback loop error correction. Dynamic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control eliminates feedback saturation errors, improves the tip-sample force control, and ensures stable successive imaging on soft and fragile samples. Fully automated alignment and calibration ensure fast cantilever drive and minimal perturbance of delicate samples. Laser excitation in the near-infrared range is optional for photosensitive and thermally unstable samples. Fast electronics and advanced algorithms ensure short feedback response times for the high-resonance 180 kHz z-scanner, typically faster than the cantilever resonance. These technological improvements allow real-time visualization of dynamic processes taking place on the millisecond scale, enabling researchers to gain better understanding of complex biological systems and molecular mechanisms. New workflow-based software, suitable for multi-user environments, produces higher throughput and allows more experiments per day. The multi-level user-friendly interface features optional guidance and context-sensitive onscreen assistance; operators, irrespective of experience level, can focus on performing novel measurements rather than troubleshooting technical challenges. Optional add-ons provide control of temperature, fluidic exchange, and the monitoring of dynamics triggered by chemical alteration, temperature, or light. Applications are predominantly in life sciences, including studies of single molecule binding dynamics, tracking of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, monitoring of enzyme kinetics, and visualization of supramolecular protein structure self-assembly. High-speed force spectroscopy applications include nanomechanical mapping of single molecules, membrane segregation, and studies of novel unfolding pathways of biomolecules. Materials science applications include monitoring of atomic-scale point defects in flat sheet inorganic minerals (calcite, mica), crystallization dynamics of polymer transitions, step-edge kinetics of inorganic crystals, and dynamics of micelle formation.", "year": 2021}

Even though this definition, or any other UX definition for that matter, do not mention that users' experiences need to be positive, the importance of experiencing positive emotions while interacting with a device is widely acknowledged. The equation\"better UX = more business\"is the motto that determined the industry to embrace this field, and at the same time, opened the path for the UX to go beyond usability guidelines and the human factors studies. It is clear that, by facilitating tasks to the users and by addressing their needs, they will be more satisfied, more engaged, and eventually, it will have positive consequences on the business. Nonetheless, some companies are willing to reach their economic goals at any cost, regardless of whether the customer's feels satisfied after obtaining what she needed. They wonder: how can we design the user interface in order to increase the possibilities of reaching our objectives in a much more effective way? Metrics related to purchase conversions, user retention and engagement become the main focus of design, and any UX research conducted is aimed at understanding the user's needs or preferences is used for this purpose. In these cases, design is mainly aimed at increasing the company's revenue, and companies sometimes cross the ethical line with this goal in mind. Such a phenomenon is called Dark UX.", "year": 2022}

They receive hundreds of information and have many choices. Therefore, it appears more difficult for e-commerce to optimize the customer experience and encourage them to make a purchase. The main goal of this paper is to examine the behavior of wine e-shop customers and to analyze which website components influence their process of online shopping. The research deals with the importance of user\u00b4s experience and examines the question of the optimal combination of individual elements in the wine e-shop. The focus is on three areas: specific filters, graphic design and product descriptions; which are essential for purchase decision making in the process of online shopping. In order to reach the goal and examine the aforementioned areas, we looked at the following: 1. Product impact, that includes the product information on the website; 2. Orientation impact, including filter functions and orientation on the website; 3. Customer service impact, that depicts the general information about the e-shop and related fees presented on the website. To achieve this, we did an A/B testing on two variants of the website, created as prototypes for this research. We combined it with \u201ethink aloud\u201c method in order to define connections between used elements and customer behavior. Our results show the optimal combination of elements that guide purchase decision making in the case of wine e-shop, and improve the customer online shopping experience.

Among those monitors, a relatively simple device is aiming at measuring the X-ray fluorescence and the X-ray scattering (elastic and inelastic) signal emitted from a thin foil with a punctual detector, a combination of several punctual detectors or a 2D detector. To improve the design of this kind of monitor, an analytical simulation has been developed to estimate the recording signal intensity according to the foil, the detector and the beam parameters. The mains X-ray interaction with matter processes involved in these monitors are simulated and several parameters of the incident X-ray beam are taken into account such as its intensity, energy, size and polarization. Furthermore, in contrast to the complex and time-consuming Monte-Carlo method, this analytical simulation is performed in few seconds and is implemented in a user-friendly interface. In order to validate our tool, the simulated results were compared to a series of measurements performed on the METROLOGIE beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. The differences with the experimental results are less than 30% by using a metallic foil and less than 50% with a Kapton\u00ae foil.

The achieved accuracy of an indoor localization system is the key to enable certain applications, such as navigation. In a scenario where the system runs exclusively on commodity hardware such as smartphones and even without installing any mobile app in the mobile device, location information may be exploited not only for navigation, but also for the benefit of the network itself or for the investigation of physical behaviours. \nIn indoor areas, communication technologies such as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) are gaining popularity due to the ever increasing availability and deployment of APs that can be used simultaneously as an infrastructure for networking and positioning. Despite being the most used technology for tracking devices in indoor environments, the research community has focused more intensively on approaches such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or combining WiFi signals with inertial sensors as found in smartphones. These approaches are error prone, dependent on frequent calibrations, or they require specialized hardware or the user must be interested to run a specific application designed to run on the smartphone. \nUsing only commodity WiFi chipsets, this thesis investigates location systems that are based on Time-of-Flight (ToF) echo technique, and do not require any calibration and user intervention, and it explores ranging and location data to improve network management and infer user behaviour. \nToF technique has been modestly exploited for indoor localization, whereas ToF is successfully used in Global Positioning System (GPS) in outdoor environments. The reason is that WiFi ToF measurements, mainly extracted from commodity chipsets, suffer from extensive device-related noise which makes it challenging to differentiate between direct path from non-direct path signal components when estimating the ranges. Existing multipath mitigation techniques tend to fail at identifying the direct path when the devicerelated Gaussian noise is in the same order of magnitude, or larger than the multipath noise. In order to address this challenge, we first propose in this thesis a new method for filtering ranging measurements, extracted from a commodity WiFi chipset, that is better suited for the inherent large noise as found in WiFi radios. \n \nOur proposed filter combines statistical learning and robust statistics and it does not require specialized hardware, the intervention of the user, or cumbersome on-site manual calibration. This makes the method we propose as the first contribution of the present work particularly suitable for indoor localization in large-scale deployments using existing legacy WiFi infrastructures. We build and investigate a multi WiFi ToF-based APs localization system, where these filtered timing signals are used as ranging inputs of the multi-lateration problem for positioning. We then deploy and evaluate our system for indoor mobile tracking scenarios in many multipath-rich environments, across multiple testbeds which cover different surfaces and further test it in Microsoft indoor localization competitions, demonstrating that, despite these challenges, our technique can achieve distance accuracy comparable to other approaches proposed by the start of the art but does not share their aforementioned shortcomings. The deployment of a multi-APs positioning system is targeted to specific areas, such as large offices and shopping malls. In order to bring indoor positioning also to homes and small businesses which typically have a single AP, the next step we envision towards a hybrid single-AP positioning system is a deep inspection and interaction of the Fine Time Measurements (FTM), a type of ToF echo technique standardized recently, and Channel State Information (CSI) for ranging and Angle-Of-Arrival (AOA) for angle estimates, respectively. We exploit Physical Layer (PHY) information to detect the number of paths and their directions and we use this information to derive a new method for filtering ranging measurements obtained with the FTM protocol. We achieve sub-meter distance estimation accuracy eliminating the adverse effect of multipath in FTM using calibrated inputs from CSI. We then evaluate the system in multipath-rich environments, demonstrating the capability of the combination of AOA estimation and the proposed FTM refinement approach to achieve reasonable positioning accuracy in areas comparable to typical flat sizes just using a commodity smartphone as target device. \n \nAll the contributions described so far and all the extracted location data may be exploited also in the network core to better allocate network resources based on the expected link performance. Thus, we take advantage of positioning data and more in general context information, to enable reliable mobile communications via advanced resource management policies and adaptive traffic engineering strategies. Of particular interest for this thesis is to investigate usage of positioning data in industrial environments, where the presence of metallic objects challenge the reliability of wireless communication. With the advent of the fourth Industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) such harsh environments have attracted high attention and, for this reason, of particular interest for this thesis is also the deployment of our multi-APs system in such industrial environment. The latter, due to blockage and strong reflections, is notorious for being adverse to wireless communication, impacting on the signal quality. We propose to exploit the knowledge of location to derive context information to dynamically allocate wireless resources in time and space to target devices. We exploit the spatial geometry of the APs and a statisticalmodel that maps the user position\u2019s spatial distribution to an angle error distribution to derive a hypothesis test to declare if the link is in Line-Of-Sight (LOS) or Non-Line- Of-Sight (NLOS). In order to avoid changes to the client side and operate with a single interface radio, we use the same wireless network both for positioning and scheduling. We experimentally show that context information applied to wireless resources protocol help increasing the network throughput in the aforementioned industrial-like scenario. Finally, taking advantage of ranging information extracted from FTM, we propose to estimate the device movement without any access to physical inertial sensors in the mobile. The idea is to infer the movements of the mobile through radio measurements, a concept we call \u201dvirtual inertial sensors\u201d. We propose a method for estimating the user walking speed and a novel method for the rotation of a mobile device. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed approaches with experiments, and we compare the rotation method with a possible solution that explores CSI measurements. While FTM works with only one single antenna, it achieves better performance than a CSI-based estimator that exploits four antennas and multiple sub-carriers at the AP, but are yet limited by the typical one single WiFi antenna at the smartphone side. This new concept of virtual inertial sensors can be leveraged by location systems and sensing mechanisms to improve localization accuracy, infer user behavior, and design better and more secure communication. \n \nIn conclusion, in this thesis we experimentally demonstrate that ToF data, extracted from commodity WiFi chipsets, can be used for tracking devices and provide context information in indoor environments without the need for environmental calibration and installations of mobile apps, but only with standard-compliant measurements performed from the WiFi infrastructure.", "year": 2020}

{"paperId": "463d0d2275db306917bb6bd51f4fa9de2988bebd", "title": "BLENDED LEARNING IN PRACTICE", "abstract": "Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) has attracted a lot of attention as a highly engaging learning method that enhances the learning outcomes of the participants and allows them to build transferable digital skills while having fun. In this paper, we are investigating the theory and the rationale behind integrating a DGBL learning activity into the curriculum and we are presenting such a DGBL paradigm for Level 4 Pharmacy students of the University of Hertfordshire. The activity requires the students to work in small groups and present an assignment to the rest of their class by the means of an animation video, using basic coding principles at an online platform. While their digital skills as Pharmacy students might not include coding, the challenge and the freedom to present their assignment using their own script and animations of choice, enhance their learning experience. Such activities integrate a range of desirable graduate attributes and are working in the direction of producing multidisciplinary and adaptable scientists, unafraid of digital challenges. Keywords; Digital Game-Based Learning, Pharmacy, Coding Introduction \u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged that Pharmacy students must be in need of good teaching practices\u201d. To any Jane Austen aficionado reader, like the author of this paper, the above phrase would surely bring a smile on their face and would have caught their attention. This simple example shows how important it is to speak the \u201csame language\u201d with your audience. In the case of higher education institutions, where the majority of the audience has just reached adulthood, mastering this \u201clanguage\u201d is a constant challenge for the educator. And it is not only the \u201clanguage\u201d that has to evolve, the same applies to teaching methods; pharmacy teaching has transitioned away from a product-centered emphasis, toward a patient-centered focus, albeit there is still a debate on the science/practice balance in the undergraduate teaching (Jesson et al., 2006; Gleason et al., 2011). Pharmacy students do not know from the start of their studies whether they will follow an academic-research based career or the \u201ctraditional\u201d practice-in-a-pharmacy route. For this reason, it is important to ensure students are trained to enhance their scientific expertise as BLENDED LEARNING IN PRACTICE | Autumn 2020 Page | 10 well as a patient-centered attitude. This is not achieved solely by deep clinical knowledge; a well-rounded pharmacist should integrate skills, attitudes, values and behaviors with knowledge to their practice activities during their education. In 2013, the Educational Outcomes of the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE), were \u201cintentionally expanded beyond knowledge and skills to include the affective domain, in recognition of the importance of professional skills and personal attributes to the practice of pharmacy\u201d (Medina et al., 2013). While there is a plethora of attributes that one could list, leadership, teamwork, adaptability and critical thinking have been highlighted as mandatory for Pharmacy education Clauson et al., 2019; Baker, Crabtree and Anderson, 2020). Educating the future pharmacists should address all the aforementioned requirements, while using modern educational approaches. The paradigm shift in education from the traditional Socratic method to a more interactive one is well documented in literature. With a 97% of youth playing computer and video games (Jenkins, 2013), the phrase \u201conline games\u201d is as familiar to new undergraduate students of all disciplines as is \u201cfood\u201d. With this in mind, it is no wonder that in the quest to move away from the traditional full-textbook based teaching, gamification strategies and game-based learning (GBL) have attracted a lot of attention. While gamification is the use of different motivating elements such as score cards that foster competition between users, GBL is linked to the cognitive area of the product with game content and game play enhancing the acquisition of knowledge and skills (Qian and Clark, 2016). GBL is an interactive learning environment where the user actively develops their knowledge according to their experiences; such experiences involve problem solving and challenges that leave the learner with a sense of achievement (Gamelearn, no date; Jessica Trybus, 2015; Qian and Clark, 2016; Sera and Wheeler, 2017). It is not in the scope of this paper to provide a detailed review of GBL strategies; if the reader is interested then the highly detailed review of Qian and Clark, 2016, is a recommended read. However, it should be noted that a key element of GBL activities adding to their popularity and success is that they are fun and can also be part of a flipped classroom learning strategy (Lam et al., 2019). The role of games in pharmacy education was addressed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Report of the 2013\u20132014 Academic Affairs Committee (Cain et al., 2014). It was suggested that educational gaming should be encouraged among colleges and schools of pharmacy, as it has been shown that using games for learning purposes can increase examination scores, the student-learner satisfaction and motivation to learn, and increased collaborations (Cain et al., 2014). To this end, a plethora of GBL studies have been explored such as escape-rooms (Clauson et al., 2019; Baker, Crabtree and Anderson, 2020), role-playing (Basheti, 2014; Lucas et al., 2019) alongside other active-learning approaches (Sumanasekera et al., 2020). BLENDED LEARNING IN PRACTICE | Autumn 2020 Page | 11 With the facilitation of the continuous technological advancements, Digital Game-based Learning (DGBL) has emerged. Linking back to the fact that students are already familiar with most digital tools and with the concept of online/digital gaming, the main advantage of DGBL is that it associates the active involvement of the learner with a fun element; the tool is not used only for entertainment but to enhance the knowledge (Perini et al., 2018). Educational gaming has become a reality even on mobile platforms (Crompton and Burke, 2018; Troussas, Krouska and Sgouropoulou, 2020). Looking into the evolution of the field, the characterization of gamification has evolved from \u201cthe use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts\u201d into \u201cthe use of game mechanics and experience design to digitally engage and motivate people to achieve their goals.\u201d (Sera and Wheeler, 2017; Fogarty, 2019). Game mechanics also give the learner the freedom of choice. The game environment may allow the learner to explore different areas, and quests or challenges can be presented to allow the learner the opportunity to complete tasks of choice (Sera and Wheeler, 2017). As an active learning activity, it also engages students as partners in the teaching-learning process and helps them take more responsibility for their own learning\u201d (Gleason et al., 2011). An online GBL platform with an easy and pleasant user interface enhances the enjoyment of students, which, in turn, affects the learning outcome. The positive influences of DGBL over student learning have been associated with the theory of flow experience; a psychological state characterized by complete engagement and immersion in an activity (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991; Chen and Chang, 2020). In Pharmacy education, it was suggested that using virtual GBL and technology could enhance the learning of the students in the classrooms. One example of such a technology is Mimycx, sponsored by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) and Professions Quest. Mimycx is a multiplayer online role-playing game that includes interactive quests used to teach health professional students critical thinking skills in a virtual medical environment. In every game/quest, avatars are engaged in virtual adventures that have been designed to be case-based and health-related. Thanks to the nature of such a DGBL technology, the students are familiar with the concepts of quests and what is required of them while real-time social interaction, communication, and teamwork via verbal and text chatting functionalities is encouraged (Lam et al., 2019). Another excellent example of digital game-based learning in pharmacy education is Kahoot!\u00ae a web-based game multiple-choice trivia quiz developed to allow pharmacy students at a school in the United Kingdom to review various aspects of the curriculum in preparation for their licensing examinations (Dell and Chudow, 2019). While using Kahoot! \u00ae, the students worked collaboratively, created quizzes discussions and surveys, while addressing both simulated and real-life problems. During the post-intervention survey, 59.3% of students claimed they would use the game in the future for other work and 60.4% of respondents BLENDED LEARNING IN PRACTICE | Autumn 2020 Page | 12 would appreciate a similar activity for other pharmacy modules (Sera and Wheeler, 2017; Dell and Chudow, 2019). Overall, DGBL activities are relevant and familiar to the current generation of students and thanks to their approachability and enjoyability they provide an alternative educational strategy suitable to a modern classroom, making them a powerful tool that further enhances learning in higher education. As a brief summary DGBL has the following positive characteristics: \u2022 Allows the sequencing of tasks and activities \u2022 It is highly and actively engaging (fun) \u2022 The learning pace is controlled and tailored to each student \u2022 There is immediate feedback to student mistakes \u2022 It builds up transferable skills like problem-solving and creativity \u2022 The learner upon completing the challenge/learning activity has a sense of achievement DGBL methods for a digital literate Pharmacy student It has been found that students who develop digital literacies as an integral part of their learning are more effective in their study and more employable on graduation \u2013 over 90% of new graduate jobs require digital c", "year": 2020}

Every two months, Healthbox delivers boxes to users homes filled with new, interesting, full size, healthy products. The Healthbox informs and inspires users about new products and brands, and ensures an always up-to-date healthy lifestyle. Each Healthbox is created by a health-related ambassador and has a minimum value of 90 Euro. A Healthbox can be ordered once or users can purchase a subscription which lasts for at least one year. Healthbox pursues an ideal situation which implies selling as many boxes as possible. To make sure more boxes are sold, users should first be made aware of the existence of the brand and the product Healthbox offers. It is assumed that more purchases are made in case more users know about the existence of the brand. So in order to meet the desired situation, the brand awareness of Healthbox should be increased. In the past few years, Healthbox has noticed the positive effects of user-generated content shared on social media in relation to its sales. User-generated content shared on social media increases brand awareness and can positively influences users purchase behaviour. Today\u2019s user might often be relying on the recommendation and opinion of a friend or acquaintance found within their social media network. This process of getting users to buy through user-generated content describes a behaviour change. These findings were the starting point for this graduation project. In order to contribute to Healthbox desired situation, this graduation project provides a fitting solution for increasing the brand awareness. The fitting solution is designed around company, context and users needs, concerns and abilities by means of a user-centered approach. The final design implies a product-service system which stimulates and supports users to share content about Healthbox during the unpacking process. First, an extensive external, internal and users analysis (including desk research, an online survey, observations, context mapping and interviews) led to different \u2018enablers for sharing\u2019. Insights from the analysis showed that users are stimulated to share in case they receive a memorable experience or material gain in terms of rewards. Findings from the user analysis combined with literature research gained knowledge about many different ways to deliver memorable experiences. Positive surprises in terms of added value, desired additional information and experiences that fit user needs work up to memorable experiences. Furthermore, users indicated that the final design should inspire, motivate and support, the call-to-action should be placed at the fingertips and the design should be easy accessible regarding usability. This analysis phase highlighted different opportunities and threats concerning sharing online content. The analysis and more in depth focus on sharing content introduces the ideation phase in which solutions concerning the problem situation are generated. By performing individual and co-creation sessions, fitting solutions to different considerations were found. Insights from these creative session resulted in three different design directions which were validated by the users and evaluated based on predetermined criteria. Eventually, the ideation phase led to the creation of a new unpacking experience with: \u2018the Experience kit\u2019. The experience kit opens up a wealth of new intuitive interactions between user and Healthbox. A new unpacking experience generates intrigue and triggers engagement. Using the experience kit stimulates and supports users to create and share content about Healthbox during the unpacking process. The product fits users needs, concerns and abilities by offering added value and a possibility to receive material gain. Desired additional information is provided by means of a seamless connection with a health-related ambassador. This unique experience changes the current unpacking experience and gives it texture and reality through desired elements of discovery and surprise. Adding this unique experience will allow Healthbox to offer their users a memorable experience, leading to increased user appreciation and brand loyalty, while simultaneously trigger the user to recommend the brand to others. Even better, the experience kit will be passed around friends and family because of its fun and interactive nature, spreading the brand message even further. Using real product prototypes, a simulation of the Experience kit was tested among many (potential) users. Insights showed high user acceptance and potential, however some challenges regarding feasibility remain. The end of this report describes how the company should face these challenges in order to work up to realization of the design. This graduation report has hopefully inspired Healthbox regarding increasing its brand awareness approached from an user-centered perspective.", "year": 2017}

It aims at improving their quality of life by helping users recover their independence when feeding, aided by the proposed system. Previous research presents solutions that often lack functionality to meet the user's needs, such as a lack of emergency functions or the use of passive feeding techniques, due to the absence of adequate human-robot interaction. The proposed solution involves the design of an interface adapter between the robot arm and the spoon, for the correct transport and positioning of the food. Moreover, a PD-type electronic controller is implemented for the robot arm; it includes gravity compensation and trajectories defined from the detection of the user's position. Additionally, the system has two safety features: an emergency button and a proximity warning that triggers when undesired objects are too close to the robot arm. The proposed system was validated through position tests and interaction with people using rice and oatmeal. When carrying out the tests with rice, 80% success was obtained, while in the case of oatmeal, 98.9% success was achieved.", "year": 2022}

To explore solutions with a potential to improve user satisfaction with these systems, an iterative user-centered design was done to propose personalized system behavior and an easy-to-use user interface (UI) for total light management (TLM). The steps included defining the semi-automatic system behavior that implicitly derives user lighting preferences from user interaction with the system. Four control options were evaluated in an expert review. Based on the received feedback a redesigned UI was subsequently evaluated as part of the TLM system in a Wizard-of-Oz study. The results showed that the UI offering direct control of lighting dimming level and the position of the blinds offered higher level of usability than the UI with indirect control in which a user defines the desired illuminance from a combination of artificial lighting and daylight.", "year": 2021}

The number of students who pay attention to the traditional fields of employment and whether they can find a job related to their majors has decreased year by year. In contrast, the Internet industry has gradually become the preferred field of employment for economics and management major students as this field is featured with innovation and high salary. In this context, the course \"Introduction to E-Commerce\" has also become a compulsory basic course for most economics and management majors. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is the product brought along with the development of Internet technology. At present, the Internet applications are undergoing rapid changes, so the theoretical knowledge of electronic commerce needs to be updated quickly. Under the background of \"Internet Plus\", this paper conducts reform of the course \"Introduction to E-commerce\" oriented by improving students\u2019 ability of Internet applications, and explores the application of modularized teaching content and diversified teaching methods in the \"Introduction to E-commerce\" course. 1. Analysis of the Necessity to Reform the \"Introduction to E-Commerce\" Course Under the Employment-Oriented Background 1.1 Economics and Management Major Students Tend to Find Jobs in the Internet Field. According to the statistics from the Ministry of Education, the number of college graduates reached 8.2 million in 2018. In recent years, the college graduates have been experiencing increasing pressure to find a job, and students majoring in economics and management is the main force of college graduates every year. A survey by Wutongguo, a campus recruitment platform, shows that the Internet industry has become the most favored industry for graduates in 2018. Recently, as the \"Internet Plus\" model has been initiated with the information technology driving the development of traditional sectors , the demand for talents in the Internet industry is also constantly increasing, thus creating more employment opportunities for college graduates. Those who were born in the 1990s grew up in the era of Internet. Their thinking modes and behaviors have been deeply influenced by the Internet and they are more familiar with and be fond of the Internet industry. Therefore, these graduates are more inclined to look for jobs in the Internet industry. Most application-oriented undergraduate colleges and universities aim at cultivating talents with applicable skills for regional economy, so their employment level also reflects their talent cultivation level to some extent. Consequently, in order to improve the employment rate of undergraduates, it is necessary to reform the teaching of existing courses with the orientation of improving students' employability. 2019 9th International Conference on Education and Management (ICEM 2019) Copyright \u00a9 (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/icem.2019.008 31 1.2 Internet Applications are Undergoing Rapid Changes, and the Knowledge of E-Commerce is Also Updated Quickly. E-commerce has emerged as the result of the application of Internet technology in the business realm. At present, the Internet technology is developing rapidly. The integration of technology and commerce is deepening, which has imposed a great subversive effect on the entire trade and retail industry chain. The maturity and popularization of the mobile Internet, Internet of things, big data and cloud computing technology have given birth to more e-commerce models. As the \"Internet Plus\" process is pushed forward and further developed, the enterprises' concept of applying e-commerce has gradually developed from the single sales channel in the past to a broader business platform. \"Big e-commerce\" has become a new concept of e-commerce in the \"Internet Plus\" era [1]. The course \"Introduction to E-commerce\" systematically summarizes the knowledge about electronic commerce, which is the basic course for network marketing, electronic commerce and other economics and management majors, as well as the introductory course for economics and management major students to learn and grasp knowledge about electronic commerce. Therefore, the contents covered in the course \"Introduction to E-commerce\" should also keep pace with the times, follow the latest development and application of electronic commerce in the \"Internet Plus\" era, pay attention to the synchronization of theoretical knowledge and practical application, and carry out educational activities based on the thinking mode of \"big e-commerce\". 1.3 More Abundant Teaching Resources have become Accessible in the \"Internet Plus\" Environment. In the \"Internet Plus\" environment, online education is not only the integration of e-commerce and the education industry, but also lays a foundation for e-commerce education and teaching. Firstly, the network provides more extracurricular e-commerce knowledge and information for students to deeply understand this subject. With the help of search engines and platforms like Zhihu (an oline knowledge-sharing platform), classroom knowledge can be supplemented. Secondly, by resorting to online platforms like Zhihuishu and Chaoxing Fanya, teachers can build online courses on the network platform and carry out flipped classes among the students they teach by integrating online teaching with offline guidance. Thirdly, professional third-party online education platforms such as Chinese University MOOC (www.icourse163.com), MOOC China (www.mooc.cn) and IMOOC (www.imooc.com) can provide open classes from prestigious universities and famous professors, so that students can choose and learn courses on their own majors or other majors according to their own needs and interest. In short, more abundant network teaching resources are accessible in the \"Internet Plus\" environment, which enables the teachers to carry out online teaching and guide students to consciously supplement professional knowledge. 1.4 The Students Who are the Audience of the Course are Equipped with a Good Knowledge Reserve About E-Commerce Applications. E-commerce has been developing in China for more than 20 years and young people at the age between 18 and 30 are the major audience of most applications that target at individual users. Nowadays, college students are exposed to computers and networks at an early age, and the emergence of smart devices also reduces the application cost of e-commerce users. Most students have rich experience of online shopping and other e-commerce applications. Therefore, for these college students, basic knowledge and applications can no longer satisfy their learning needs. The course should be designed to improve their ability of applying the Internet and information technology and focus on cultivating their Internet thinking mode, their comprehensive application ability and their capability of innovation and entrepreneurship.", "year": 2019}

Miners, like the rest of the industry, have been looking hard at their costs as commodity prices have plummeted. However, forwardthinking companies know that it\u2019s more important than ever to reap the benefits software can provide. Miners are still investing in mine design and planning technology to reduce operating costs through finetuning mining plans, increase efficiency in operations and redefine their economic mining areas. Mining projects are becoming more complex and more expensive to develop, so planning technology is critical in helping owners identify operations they wish to retain to carry them through the downturn, which operations to divest and which to acquire. In line with this, and despite overall reduced spending by the mining industry in 2015, most major software providers have reported an increase in their customer base over the past 12 months. Shaun Maloney, CEO at ARANZ Geo, tells MM: \u201cWe have continued to see strong demand and growth as companies seek to drive greater innovation and efficiencies into their existing workflows and processes. \u201c2016 looks to be another challenging year; companies are likely to continue to focus on extracting greater value from their existing assets with technology seen as a key to achieving this.\u201d Bill Wilkinson, product manager for mine planning and design solutions at ABB\u2019s Enterprise Software product group, reports similar findings: \u201cWhile we saw overall reduced spending by the mining industry in 2015, the MineScape customer base increased by 6%, and these new customers accounted for 30% of the 2015 MineScape licence revenues. \u201cExisting customers continued to expand their user licences, and we saw an increase in customer retention. With our new customers, we saw increased interest in our subscription-based licensing, which significantly reduces the initial cost of purchasing software.\u201d In particular, software vendors that have invested in enterprise applications are seeing a renewed interest in what they are doing, perhaps more so than those that have focused on increasing features and functions in their desktop products. \u201cWe are seeing a definite move by the mining majors to enterprise architecture,\u201d says Richard Mathews, CEO at RungePincockMinarco (RPM). \u201cThe leading miners understand that they have to be able to share data right across their operations in an accurate and timely manner, if they want to continue to get their costs per tonne down and productivity up. \u201cWe believe that the next 12 months will be as tough as, if not tougher than, the last 12 months. History has shown that in challenging times, companies that are able to innovate and deliver solutions which provide value and savings to their customers will do OK, and those that cannot will find it very difficult to survive.\u201d Despite the difficult conditions predicted, there is still an air of optimism for the coming financial year, and with a number of large tradeshows on the horizon including Bauma and MINExpo, there is a flurry of new and improved products planned for release. ABB MineScape is part of ABB\u2019s Intelligent Mining Solutions (IMS) suite, which provides an integrated solution from exploration through to mine design and planning. IMS products include the MineMarket logistics and sales solution; CCLAS laboratory information management system; and Production Accounting, which tracks and pinpoints losses within ore-processing systems. ABB releases two versions of its software solutions per year. In 2015, MineScape 5.9 and MineScape 5.10 were added. New features include: CoalLog 2.0 support; an industrystandard database for data storage, facilitating Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) studies; New Pit Optimization plug-in for defining economic pit limits and phases; 64-bit version for enhanced performance; Increased graphics performance; Software developer kit for creating plug-ins; New interface features; and Integration between MineScape Schedule and MineMarket.", "year": 2016}

Originality / Value This paper suggests contribution to the board of directors\u2019 air freshener product Keyword: Brand Name, Packaging, Product Quality, Price, Advertising, Purchase Intention and Air Freshener. Introduction Every product that is produced and offered to consumers is of course a product that has its own charm, both from the manufacturer's side and from the consumer side. The appeal of these products is product excellence such as product uniqueness, product quality, economic benefits, persuasiveness in advertising, and so on. Product attractiveness is a booster factor of consumer buying interest in the products offered, as well as air freshener products that have an appeal that is able to attract consumers' buying interest. Interest in buying itself according to Kotler and Keller (2016) is a consumer behavior where consumers have the desire to buy or choose a product, based on experience in choosing, using and consuming or even wanting a product. The interest in buying International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 7, July, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 \u00a9 2019 HRMARS 472 consumers is based on several factors such as, Brand Name, Packaging, Product Quality, Price, Advertising. The five factors are the attractiveness of a product, so there is a correlation with consumer buying interest. Brand Name according to Richardson, Dick, and Jain (1994) used extrinsic cues to infer and / or maintain perceptions of quality and represent information about a product, in an air freshener product that has a unique Brand Name because air freshener stands for Dry Room Anti-Air Freshener Mosquitoes are a piece of identity and product information. Packaging according to Olson and Jacoby (1972) are attributes related to products but not part of the physical product itself, Packaging Room Fragrances that carry the Shabby Chic theme and use burlap cloth as the packaging is unique and becomes a product identity and is true not a physical part from the Bunker product itself because the core of the Bunker is dried flowers. Quality products according to Kotler and Armstrong (2012) are the product's ability to perform its functions, it includes the product's overall durability, reliability, precision, operation and repair, and other valued attributes. Product Quality offered from room fragrances is the use of natural ingredients and minimizes the use of chemicals that are safer to use in terms of health that are classified as product quality. Price according to Kotler and Keller (2014) price is one element of the marketing mix that generates income, this element produces costs. Price is the easiest element in marketing programs to adjust, product features, channels and even communication requires a lot of time. The price offered on room fragrances is Rp. 20,000 which are classified as economical with all the advantages and quality of products that are suitable even though it still has shortcomings but all can be tolerated and the room fragrances themselves always try to suppress all deficiencies to maximize customer satisfaction and attract other consumers to buy. Advertising according to Jefkins (1997) is the most persuasive sales message that is directed to (potential) the most potential consumers of certain goods or services at the most economical cost. Room fragrances in advertising are quite persuasive and effective, as evidenced by the existence of a number of sales platforms that can attract consumers' buying interest, which have now entered the era of the Industrial Revolution, where everything must be fast, practical, and efficient. In addition, by using influencer services that are now very influential quickly in the minds of consumers, as well as participating in bazaar or SME programs to expand the product introduction network to consumers. The five things above are factors that have a relationship and influence consumer buying interest in the product. This has an impact on buying interest in fragrances. This research measures the extent to which consumers buy interest in air freshener products that will be launched into the market. Literature Review Brand Name Brand names are generally used extrinsic cues to infer and / or maintain perceived quality and can represent a collection of information about a product (Richardson, Dick, and Jain, 1994). Smith, Brynjolfson (2001), emphasizes that despite ongoing consideration of the importance of branding as a marketing strategy for strong positioning and differentiation, consumers use brand names as a International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 7, July, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 \u00a9 2019 HRMARS 473 symbol of dependence on service quality for non-contract aspects of products. However, marketers are aware of this, they tend to cut short process naming (Kronrod & Lowrey, 2016), which can cause brand names to not reach their highest standards in serving their goals. Gontijo, Rayman, Zhang and Zaidel (2002) study revealed that brand names are easily processed and more accurate than if not words but less accurate and slower to process when common nouns are used. A well-known brand name that is associated with a positive brand image creates competitive advantage in terms of increasing consumer interest, attention, and positive evaluation of a product, and encouraging repeat purchases (Shen, 2001). Consumers tend to allocate more attention to known brands and make more efforts to process information about a product with a well-known brand name (Shen, 2001). When consumers lack knowledge about the attributes of a product and are uncertain about the product, brand names play a role important in reducing perceived risk and assessing product quality (Dean, 1999). The brand name becomes a powerful tool for multinational corporations in standardization and training positives, profitable market share in international frontiers (Adamu & Bambale, 2016). English and Japanese brand names were used to control conclusions and variations in prior knowledge of each individual product (Moriuchi & Jackson, 2017). Packaging One of the most popular is packaging and most attractive products (Farooq, Habib, & Aslam, 2014). Product packaging has a strong influence on consumer purchase intentions especially at the point of sale (Khan, Waheed, & Ahmad, 2018). Packaging is an attribute associated with the product but not part of the physical product itself (Olson and Jacoby, 1972). While Arens (1996) explains that packaging is a product container that includes the physical appearance of the container, including design, color, labeling, shape, and materials used. Design, quality and color of packaging has a strong influence on consumer purchasing behavior. Packaging is the main selling proposition that helps consumers to differentiate products (Silayoi, & Speece, 2007). Packaging can also be interpreted as an object that serves to protect certain products that are in it and can provide certain images to persuade users (Mudra, 2010). Packaging material is a useful tool for convenience and competitive advantage, Packaging materials are also important to protect the product, if the material is used enough, customers are attractive to the products. (Hussain, Ibrahim, & Noreen, 2015). Roduct packaging plays an integral role for conveying the brand message to its target customers (Nancarrow, 1998). The visual aspect of packaging has a role in establishing direct relationships with customers and their effects on customer mind (Deng, 2009). Product Quality According to Kotler and Armstrong (2012: 283) product quality is \"the product's ability to perform its functions, it includes the product's overall durability, reliability, precision, ease of operation and repair, and other value-valued attributes.\" Garvin (1998) have proposed the following eight dimensions of quality: (1) Performances : a product's primary operating characteristic. (2) Features: the additional features or bells and whistles of the product, (3) Conformance: the product's design and operating characteristics, which are the probability that a product will operate (a) Serviceability: International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 7, July, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 \u00a9 2019 HRMARS 474 the speed, competence, and courtesy of a specified period of time under stated conditions of use, (5) Serviceability: the speed, competence, and courtesy of repair, (7) Aesthetics: how a product appeals to our five senses, (8) Customer perceived quality: customer's perception of a quality product based on the reputation on the fi (Wang & Li-Yan, 2016) ... The rank of the consumers in United States placed for product quality are as follows (1) reliability, (2) durability, (3) easy maintenance, (4) ease of use, (5) a trusted brand name and (6) low price (McDaniel, Lamb and Hair, 2011). Product quality is a key factor in assessing purchase intention. It is a continuous process of improvement that results in continuous changes in product performance and consequently the satisfaction of customers' needs (Tobergte & Curtis, 2013). Price The price is defined as the money exchange customers in terms of service or product, or the value they receive (Kotler and Arms", "year": 2019}

An individual sitting in front of a computer may use all of the internet's resources to purchase or sell things. Unlike conventional commerce, which is carried out physically with a person's effort to travel and obtain items, e- commerce has made it simpler for humans to eliminate physical labor and save time. This online business management system has also assisted retailers in saving money on upfront costs such as storefronts and staff. The objective is to design an advanced e- commerce system with a smart chatbot to provide a user-friendly experience for consumers. Consumers will save time with the quick accessibility feature of the chatbots in the system. With the help of natural language processing, we have developed a realtime chatbot with smart features. On this smart e-commerce website, we have tried to solve some of the problems with the existing e-commerce platform in our country. The system operates on the Django platform, which is built on Python. The system's architecture is created by using Django's Model-View- Template. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap are utilized for the front end and validation. For the backend, we have used an SQLite database. Clients, as it has been discovered, usually have a difficult time shopping on e-commerce because no support assistant can provide immediate feedback. The system consists of several sections, including the registration system, the login system, the search system, the order system, the add product system, the view product system, the order received system, and an interface to communicate with the bot. If users have any queries, they may contact the admin panel via the contact us page. Overall, the system is quick and reliable. A user-friendly interface boosts the purchasing experience for consumers across the country who have access to the internet. The system's accuracy is high enough for satisfying results and thus successfully supports people in making better judgments while being low-cost and user-friendly in design.", "year": 2022}

In Brazil, the growth of online shopping was 75% and in China, sales through e-commerce are expected to surpass sales in physical stores for the next two years to come (e-Marketer, 2021). In the age of digital interactions, consumers demand a new level of concern. Being at the center in the making of products and services, users define any and all design decisions. Euromonitor, in a report issued in late 2020, pointed out that approximately 60% of consumers between 15 and 29 years old used augmented reality or virtual reality in the last year at the same time that 68% of consumers over 60 years old prefer to talk to human representatives when making transactions or purchases. This proves the need to rethink the experience offered in physical retail, incorporating different generations and shopping habits. Although attracted by the speed and convenience of the virtual environment, customers are looking for personalized and multi-sensory shopping experiences that only physical stores are able to offer. In order to claim their importance and permanence in the current scenario that moves with dynamism, these points of sale must include in the experience they offer personalized solutions that involve, for instance, sensory stimulation and technology. When consistent with the brand image, product, and target audience, these solutions can, together, create a more compelling experience.Marketing or sensory branding consists of the precise use of environmental elements in order to act on the senses and generate affective, cognitive and behavioral reactions, which can contribute to usability and satisfaction, as well as memory and decision-making processes. Through technology, in addition to simplifying tasks, it becomes possible to make visible what would otherwise be invisible or even hide what is irrelevante in the shaping of the shopping journey. In attendance as mnemonic aids, like smartphones and tablets, or even solutions for immersive experiences, as augmented or virtural reality devices, technologies must be designed according to the audience they intend to interact with. This study is characterized as an exploratory research that, through literature review, seeks to raise ideas and thoughts on technology and sensory stimulation acting as support for experience design in physical retail environments, understanding the influence they can exert on users cognitive processes and responses.

{"paperId": "4a6e4ac026fe7fec4694cf6c75ad7d789640dae8", "title": "Designing Digital Applications to Promote Physical Activity and Healthy Eatingamong Young Population", "abstract": "The study by Grieben et al. [1] recruited 36 young office workers to discuss the design points for interventions using digital technology for promoting physical activity (PA) and healthy eating. One of the major concerns regarding the use of digital applications is to sustain user engagement over time [2-4]. A conclusion of the aforementioned study emphasizes that providing users with feedback is an effective strategy for users\u2019 engagement to take into consideration in the design phase. We totally agree with their results showing that tailored feedback can contribute to raising users\u2019 engagement in PA. We previously showed similar results in a study targeting training platforms to promote wellness, self-care and PA in the home setting [5]. Participants in several studies reported feeling more motivated when using a digital application that can provide both performance information and an action plan for improvement. However, including feedback systems in digital applications may not always have a positive outcome, especially if the feedback does not match well to the users\u2019 performance or if it is not accurate enough. Recent studies point that real-time feedback, or feedback provided as soon as possible have a more positive impact in users than delayed feedback [6,7]. Planning the type, frequency and amount of feedback to provide may be a challenge for engaging different users in PA. Determining how the feedback is going to be communicated is also a key factor to consider when designing the interfaces of this kind of interventions. This is one reason among many that justifies the need of high interdisciplinary teams (high number of disciplines included in the team\u2019s member background) to design and implement this kind of interventions. Historically, digital technology has been designed by teams of mainly technologists. However, technology is a tool that drives all other important aspects of the intervention. In our experience, including practitioners, artists and sociologists among other researchers resulted in a more efficient design of the solution from several points of view, which also integrates important elements of behavioral theory.", "year": 2018}

The authors investigate the moderating role of experience with instant messaging on the team interpersonal processes (cohesion and openness) to team effectiveness relationship in virtual teams. Data were obtained from 365 virtual team members using survey methodology and analyzed using hierarchical moderated regression and multilevel analyses. They found that team cohesion has a main effect on team effectiveness. Team openness has a main effect and is moderated by experience with instant messaging, i.e., strengthens the relationship. Understanding the role of team interpersonal processes and the role of the communication media will allow managers to more effectively build virtual teams and provide effective training and support. Using the theoretical lens of channel expansion theory the authors expand theoretical, empirical and practical knowledge of this area.

As a result, the nature of team interaction and the relationship between teamwork and outcomes is evolving (Kirkman, Rosen, Tesluk, & Gibson, 2004). However, little is known about the effect of experience with CMC in enabling or hindering the impact of team processes on performance outcomes. The performance outcome we examined is team effectiveness, defined here as perceptions that the team worked effectively together in accomplishing a collaborative task. The goal of this research is to examine the moderating role of experience with CMC (i.e., instant messaging) on the relationship between team interpersonal processes (i.e., cohesion, openness) and team effectiveness in virtual teams. Our research examines the development of team interpersonal processes, or processes that involve relationships among team members (Martins, Gilson, & Maynard, 2004), and the subsequent impact on outcomes in virtual teams. The relationship between team processes and outcomes can be described by the shared mental models theory that suggests the degree to which team members share a common knowledge framework will allow team members to adapt their behavior to better complete a task (Cannon-Bowers & Salas, 2001). While this interpersonal-outcome relationship has received a great deal of attention in the literature, most empirical studies deal with face-to-face relationships not virtual teams (Martins et al., 2004). Furthermore, by their nature virtual teams may struggle more than face-to-face teams with forming cohesive bonds and sharing information openly (Alge, Wiethoff, & Klein, 2003; Warkentin, Sayeed, & Hightower, 1997); however, the possible impact of user experiences on teamwork has not been examined. Thus, we are interested to see if virtual teams can utilize these interpersonal processes (i.e., cohesion and openness) in such a way that they contribute to the effectiveness of the team and whether user experience can moderate those relationships. Thus, one contribution of the current study is that we answer the call for research on the team interpersonal processes that impact outcomes in virtual teams (Martins et al., 2004), as well as the generalizability of face-to-face communication constructs on the performance of such teams (Fjermestad, 2004; Kim, 2006). Some research has investigated cohesion in virtual teams (e.g., Cramton, 2001; Gonzalez, Burke, Santuzzi, & Bradley, 2003; Knight, Pearson, & Hunsinger, 2008; Straus, 1997; Wakefield, Leidner, & Garrison, 2008; Yoo & Alavi, 2001). For example, cohesion influences social presence and task participation in established groups (Yoo & Alavi, 2001), but the cohesion-performance link is weaker for teams using leaner communication media (Knight et al., 2008). While cohesiveness may improve team effectiveness by building collective team knowledge, team effectiveness also hinges on the extent to which team members are open and willing to share knowledge (Driskell, Radtke, & Salas, 2003). To our knowledge, team member openness, or the degree to which teammates openly share and receive information, has seldom been examined in a virtual context. We propose that both cohesion and openness will be related to team effectiveness for virtual teams. A second purpose of this study was to investigate the possible impact of \u201cchannel expansion\u201d on the participants\u2019 ability to use interpersonal team processes to develop team knowledge and subsequently accomplish teamwork. Channel expansion theory suggests that experience of several forms contributes to an individual\u2019s ability to communicate richly using a given medium (Carlson & Zmud, 1999). We are focusing exclusively on experience with the medium and its moderating role in the interpersonal processes-outcome relationship of virtual teams. In addition to the role of communication in virtual teams, technology experience has been specifically identified as a key construct to examine in collaboration technologies (Jones & Kochtanek, 2004). More specifically, the CMC technology employed in this study was designed for this investigation and uses computer-based instant messaging (\u201cIM\u201d or \u201cchat\u201d) as well as a task interface that includes a voting tool.

Women report greater difficulties quitting smoking. Concerns about weight gain, negative body image, and low self-efficacy may be key factors affecting smoking cessation among women. Recent studies suggest that a multi-behavioral approach, including diet and physical activity, may be more effective at helping women quit. Guided imagery has been successfully used to address body image concerns and self-efficacy in our 3 target behaviors\u2014exercise, diet and smoking cessation. However, it has not been used simultaneously for smoking, diet, and exercise behavior in a single intervention. While imagery is an effective therapeutic tool for behavior change, the mode of delivery has generally been in person, which limits reach. mHealth apps delivered via smart phones offer a unique channel through which to distribute imagery-based interventions. Objective The objective of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of an mHealth app for women designed to simultaneously address smoking, diet, and physical activity behaviors. The objectives are supported by three specific aims: (1) develop guided imagery content, user interface, and resources to reduce weight concern, and increase body image and self-efficacy for behavior change among women smokers, (2) program a prototype of the app that contains all the necessary elements of text, graphics, multimedia and interactive features, and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the app with women smokers. Methods We created the program content and designed the prototype application for use on the Android platform in collaboration with 9 participants in multiple focus groups and in-depth interviews. We programmed and tested the application\u2019s usability with 6 participants in preparation for an open, pre- and posttest trial. Currently, we are testing the feasibility and acceptability of the application, evaluating the relationship of program use to tobacco cessation, dietary behaviors, and physical activity, and assessing consumer satisfaction with approximately 70 women smokers with Android-based smart phones. Results The study was started January 1, 2014. The app was launched and feasibility testing began in April 1, 2015. Participants were enrolled from April 1-June 30, 2015. During that time, the app was downloaded over 350 times using no paid advertising. Participants were required to use the app \u201cmost days\u201d for 30 days or they would be dropped from the study. We enrolled 151 participants. Of those, 78 were dropped or withdrew from the study, leaving 73 participants. We have completed the 30-day assessment, with a 92% response rate. The 90-day assessment is ongoing. During the final phase of the study, we will be conducting data analyses and disseminating study findings via presentations and publications. Feasibility will be demonstrated by successful participant retention and a high level of app use. We will examine individual metrics (eg, duration of use, number of screens viewed, change in usage patterns over time) and engagement with interactive activities (eg, activity tracking). Conclusions We will aggregate these data into composite exposure scores that combine number of visits and overall duration to calculate correlations between outcome and measures of program exposure and engagement. Finally, we will compare app use between participants and non-participants using Google Analytics.", "year": 2016}

The Effects of M-Commerce Chatbot Interface on Source Credibility, Social Presence, Trust, and Purchase Intention", "abstract": "Most chatbot interfaces in contemporary m-commerce platforms feature a single chatbot that provides recommendations for all product categories. Nonetheless, there is an emerging research interest in multi-chatbot systems designating multiple chatbots as product/domain-specific advisers. Given the dearth of studies investigating the effects of multi-chatbot versus single-chatbot in the m-commerce context, we addressed this research gap by conducting an online between-subjects experiment to explore how the m-commerce chatbot interface types can differently influence source credibility, social presence, trusting beliefs, and purchase intention. Based on 154 valid responses, the single-chatbot interface led to higher social presence and trusting beliefs toward the m-commerce platform than the multi-chatbot interface. Males attributed the chatbot with higher competence and reported higher purchase intention through the m-commerce platform when engaging with the single-chatbot interface than the multi-chatbot interface. These findings suggest that designating chatbots as product-specific advisers in a multi-chatbot interface without labels to accentuate expertise could not evoke the users to categorize them as product specialists. Moreover, the multi-chatbot interface could have imposed user confusion and unfamiliarity cues, decreasing trust in the m-commerce platform. These findings\u2019 theoretical, design, and managerial implications are discussed through the lens of the computers-are-social-actors paradigm, source credibility theory, source specialization, multiple source effect, and m-commerce behavioral research.", "year": 2022}

Sixty-five male and female students participated in this study; they were homogenous in terms of their English language level, the English language course they studied, and the LMS they used. A questionnaire was used to gather and analyse the quantitative data. The results revealed the Saudi learners\u2019 overall positive perceptions of the LMS\u2019s contribution (particularly its provision of learning resources) to their listening proficiency. The resources included a wide range of materials, practice contexts, and listening skill exercises. The participants claimed that the LMS effectively catered to various learning preferences to support their language acquisition. However, some areas of the LMS require improvement according to data gathered in this study. Although the results showed that the LMS system is generally user-friendly, a better interface design could provide a smoother, more enjoyable user experience. Additionally, strategies to boost learners\u2019 motivation and engagement in listening practices, such as gamification and interactive exercises, could be further explored. This research contributes valuable insights to empower Saudi learners in improving their English listening skills through technology-assisted language learning. The study illuminates the LMS\u2019s potential as a valuable tool for enhancing listening skills among Saudi second language (L2) learners. Despite its strengths, refining user interfaces and fostering motivation for more effective and sustained language learning outcomes would ultimately benefit Saudi learners in achieving English language proficiency.", "year": 2024}

Theoretical background and research questions Over the last decade, the development of technology has completely transformed the urban living environment: video conferences and emails generated new means of working (e.g. home office), online stores saw the rise of new means of shopping, and smartphones promoted new modes of transportation (eg. Uber). Urban management has improved through massive use of technology and data to optimize flows and resources (eg. dynamic taxes, automatized traffic lights, smart waste management), and generated the smart city model. In the field of urban planning, the advent of technology has facilitated the process, by simplifying exchanges and data processing, while reducing costs and saving time. However, processes have not really evolved, even though the concept behind smart cities precisely calls for smart planning. Technology and urban data offer great potential to transform the urban planning system and adapt it to forthcoming issues [1,2]. Similar to the radical changes that occurred with the development of printing technology, digitization creates new possibilities of information production, analysis, and exchange [3]. New planning tools and methods are needed to cope with contemporary mutations, and meet the ever-changing realities of cities. Moreover, citizens are often left outside the planning process, although they hold a central position to produce and share useful knowledge on how they live and use the city [4\u20137]. Indeed, the development of technology and the widespread use of the Internet and smartphones offer new means to improve exchange and support urban planning [8,9]. It represents an opportunity to generate new forms of interaction between the urban planners and the city dwellers for a more sustainable and responsive planning [10,11]. Producing a large amount of user-generated and ground sensing data, digital tools offer new perspectives for a better-informed and citizen-centric planning. However, digital tools are often experimental and rarely integrated in an actual planning process. Data produced through digital methods are seldom used to inform planning [12,13]. The complexity of the issues, the social and urban dynamics and the multiplicity of stakeholders all constitute elements that call into question the process of sharing and producing information and knowledge. It is therefore important to determine the potential role that urban data and technology can play in this context. How does technology change urban planning practices? What are the opportunities and limitations of technology to improve urban planning? And finally, how should the city of tomorrow be planned? This research firstly aims to investigate how planning processes are evolving to take advantage of data and technology. Secondly, it seeks to determine the benefits and constraints of using digital tools in urban planning system, focusing in particular on knowledge and data exchange. 2. Methodology and key findings The research questions are answered by an in-depth analysis of planning processes encountered in two case studies: Singapore and Geneva. We examine the current state of planning and how it is evolving in recent years. Fieldwork comprises unstructured and semi-structured interviews with Abstract proposal for 2018 IGU Urban Commission Meeting Montreal 12th -17th August 2018proposal for 2018 IGU Urban Commission Meeting Montreal 12th -17th August 2018 experts and practitioners, on-site observations, and planning documents and tools analysis. These case studies were selected because both cities are taking steps and developing strategies towards digitalization of planning processes. In addition, both have a centralized planning system and similar processes which enables comparisons. Geneva and Singapore both seek to harness digital tools and urban data to achieve a same goal, becoming sustainable and livable cities. Despite that both case studies have different approaches to digitalization, this research was able to determine advantages and limitations of the use of digital tools for urban planning. Digital technology can be applied in various urban planning actions. It can be used to: \u2022 Improve interactions with professionals and owners: e.g. access to planning information, electronic planning submission. \u2022 Improve interactions with the public: e.g. collect and share information and knowledge, public engagement, e-participation. \u2022 Improve interactions with other agencies: e.g. share data, consultations. \u2022 Improve internal productivity: e.g. data analysis, planning support tools, monitoring, archiving. Digital tools facilitate data analysis and allow a better understanding of urban systems. Accessing precise data generates more accurate prediction which is essential for long term planning. Technology opens new channels of exchange with all the stakeholders, especially with the population. Citizens can contribute to urban planning in active ways through dedicated platforms or in passive way through user-generated data such as mobile phone data. This new kind of data enables urban planners to gather valuable insight on ground concerns and population\u2019s need. Yet, despite the number of existing digital platforms, public feedback is mainly collected in conventional face to face meetings and paper forms. In addition, despite their relevance and value to understand people\u2019s behavior and needs, user-generated data are seldom used to inform urban planning. This study highlighted some reasons that explain the lack of use of digital tools. Firstly, the actor who initiates the project plays an important role to test and use new methods. Secondly, planning agencies often consider data collected through digital means as not sufficiently reliable or believe that digital tools do not generate relevant results and thus ignore them. Thirdly, the risk of digital divide represents an obstacle to use digital means of exchange. Finally, there is still a lack of competence in planning agencies to collect and analyze digital data. The main constraint of going digital is that technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Urban planners need time to learn and adapt to new tools. Developing many tools in a short time without promoting their value and without a support framework results in lack of use or even non-use of the tools. Singapore is successful in developing tools that lower the barrier of entry to urban data analysis thus increasing awareness among urban planners. Furthermore, to be profitable, digital tools have to be part of the workflow. Moreover, changing current practices requires strong political vision. Sustainable change of practices occurs when bottom-up initiatives meet top-down strategies and goals. 3. Conclusion Technology is changing the way we live in and manage the cities on a daily basis. It is crucial to adapt planning practices to cope with these emerging challenges. Going digital not only supposes translating current practices into digital actions such as drawing plans digitally instead of manually, but calls for a change of the whole planning system as well. It is necessary to act on the production of the planning process itself, and include digital tools and data from initial stages to fully take advantage of the opportunities offered by digital means. Moreover, the role of the urban planner should be redefined from expert, top-down decision-maker to facilitator and coordinator for synthesizing pieces of relevant input. Citizens are playing a new role by producing new kind of data and being increasingly implicated in urban planning. Considered as local experts, they should be seen as relevant sources of data. Digital tools represent a new interface between inhabitants and urban planners, and therefore promote comprehensive and citizen-centric planning. Abstract proposal for 2018 IGU Urban Commission Meeting Montreal 12th -17th August 2018proposal for 2018 IGU Urban Commission Meeting Montreal 12th -17th August 2018 Cities can learn from each other and benefit from exchanging good practices, although it is important to adapt to local context. This study highlights how digital tools create new planning perspectives by considering urban processes based on user-generated data. Furthermore, it successfully determines some of the limitations that prevent the current planning model from moving towards a datainformed and inclusive planning. Further research is needed to identify the keys for changing current practices and to tackle the issue of data protection and privacy. References [1] Townsend, A.M.

Each generation presents novel techniques, standards and capacities that differ from the previous one. \nSpecifically, nowadays there is a huge proliferation of smart devices (e.g., smart glasses, smart watches, tablets, smartphones, etc.) and multimedia services (e.g., E-health, real-time video streaming, augmented reality, tactile internet\u2026) that has significantly transformed the classical concept of consumption and interaction with digital resources and that consequently has given rise to an exponential demand of higher data rates. Unlimited access to information with data exchange anywhere or anytime arises as a novel trend forcing again to the evolution of mobile wireless communications towards the fifth generation (5G).\nAs a result of the increasing demand for higher data rates imposed by the next generation of wireless communication networks, large-scale Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have been postulated as one of the main technological solutions. Concretely, these systems can not only increase the transmission capacity and improve the spectral efficiency but it can also simplify the multiple access layer, increase the robustness and reduce the air interface latency. Theoretically, the implementation of these systems is carried out using large arrays formed by hundreds of antennas elements at the same time serving tens of terminals in the same time-frequency resource. Therefore, the main idea behind this revolutionary technology consists of taking advantage of all the benefits that conventional MIMO offers, but on a greater scale. While the development of a large number of antennas is relatively feasible at the base station (BS) side due to the available space, it is not so viable at the end user side. Therefore, the user end can be considered as a clear bottle\u2013neck of the communication since in MIMO systems the throughput gains are limited by the minimum number of antennas existing at the transmitter or the receiver. With the aim of overcoming this limitation, in this Thesis textile multi\u2013antenna based terminals are presented. Specifically, the textile solution based on large\u2013scale MIMO technology explored in this work allows to provide the energy and spectral efficiency benefits offered by MIMO technology directly to the end user (e.g. exploiting their own garments or accessories) without compromising the size, weight and, ultimately the portability of the user equipment (UE).\nMotivated with the aforementioned target, the main results provided by this Thesis can be classified in three.\nFirst, the design, fabrication and experimental characterization of different textile antenna arrays is performed. Concretely, one design is developed to be integrated at the backside of a jacket operating at 3.5 GHz, while the other design is developed to be conformed in a helmet operating at 4.9 GHz. Additionally, due to the fact that the textile solution is developed to work in the very close proximity of the human body, offering information regarding the human exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) seems to be relevant. Thus, a study to quantify the specific absorption rate (SAR) is also performed. It should be noted that these designs can be applied to emergency scenarios, where first responders can improve their communication capabilities with the deployment of a large number of antennas in their garments.\nSecond, carrying out the experimental characterization of the performance in terms of achievable rates for a textile multi\u2013antenna terminal in order to show the real advantages of deploying a large number of antennas at the user end. With that objective, a measurement campaign that allows to model the wireless channel in relevant Outdoor-to-Indoor (O2I) propagation environments was performed in Valparaiso (Chile). A total of 30 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 72 \u2248 26.000 different channel fading samples, were carefully processed to extract all the relevant information required for the channel modeling. \nFinally, the third part of this Thesis pretends to evaluate the role that textile multi\u2013antenna terminals might play as a part of future public safety network solutions. In particular, the main aim consist of enabling future public safety communications overcoming the weakness of current narrow-band Private Mobile Radio (PMR) systems like Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) mainly focused on offering limited voice services. To this end, an LTE\u2013based two\u2013hop link network to reach locations with low or null coverage and a physical layer improvement via the deployment of a textile multi\u2013antenna terminal at the user side are suggested. Among other things, the device technology and the network elements required to implement such a network concept, as well as, a possible design principle based on the reliable connectivity principle required by emergency communications, are presented. Specifically, depending on the available SNR and MIMO configuration and the specific position of the relay node, we are able to predict what multimedia services will be permanently provided.", "year": 2019}

Existing input techniques either lack expressive power or may not be socially acceptable. As an alternative, thumb-to-finger touches present a promising input mechanism that is subtle yet capable of complex interactions.

Our novel sensing technique improves the reliability of continuous touch tracking and estimating pressure on resistive fabric interfaces. We demonstrate DigiTouch\u2019s utility by enabling a set of easily reachable and reconfigurable widgets such as buttons and sliders. Since DigiTouch senses continuous touch position, widget layouts can be customized according to user preferences and application needs.

We evaluate DigiTouch for text entry using a multi-session study. With our continuous sensing method, users reliably learned to type and achieved a mean typing speed of 16.0 words per minute at the end of ten 20-minute sessions, an improvement over similar wearable touch systems.", "year": 2017}

Tables afford more ergonomic postures and provide opportunities for rest, which raises the question of whether they may also benefit prolonged interaction in Virtual Reality (VR). In this paper, we investigate the effects of tabletop surface presence in situated VR settings on task performance, behavior, and subjective experience. In an empirical study, 24 participants performed two tasks (selection, docking) on virtual interfaces placed at two distances and two orientations. Our results show that a physical tabletop inside VR improves comfort, agency, and task performance while decreasing physical exertion and strain of the neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist, assessed through objective metrics and subjective reporting. Notably, we found that these benefits apply when the UI is placed on and aligned with the table itself as well as when it is positioned vertically in mid-air above it. Our experiment therefore provides empirical evidence for integrating physical table surfaces into VR scenarios to enable and support prolonged interaction. We conclude by discussing the effective usage of surfaces in situated VR experiences and provide initial guidelines.", "year": 2022}

The role that food plays is complex: it is a necessity of life, yet it also serves to enhance and impact our lives in many ways. The meal is more than an object; it is an event or lived experience where the senses meet with emotions and cognitive energies (Rozin, 1999). In the social domain, \u201cfood becomes a lens through which we may explore the stratified realities of a society, its ideas about worth, about class, sex/gender, race, religion, and even nationality and humanity\u201d (Bonnekessen, 2009, p. 280). Food is often central to the understanding of culture; the ways in which it is caught, farmed, cleaned, processed, cooked and eaten are symbolic of different kinds of meaning at many different levels (Srivivas, 2007). As eating together is perhaps the most basic expression of human sociality, ethnic cuisine (and those whom provide it) could act as the bridge between a diversity we cherish and a common humanity that must be achieved if we are to live harmoniously in an-ever flattening world (Van Den Burghe, 1984). One aspect of food that is sweeping into the subconscious of popular culture in the United States is the reincarnation of street food. Street foods, broadly defined as ready-to-eat foods and beverages prepared and/or sold by vendors or hawkers (especially in the streets and other similar places), have become a provision for social experiences that symbolize multicultural harmony for many food enthusiasts (Miles, 2011). There is an inherently authentic aspect of street food that may be why it is attractive to consumers (Camarena, Sanjuan, & Philippidis, 2011). Globally, street food operations represent a significant part of urban food consumption for millions of low-and-middle-income consumers. Street food preparation and selling provides a regular source of income for millions of men and women with limited education or skills, especially because the activity requires low initial investment. This activity also supports local agricultural producers and food processors and contributes to local and national economic growth (Steptoe A. P., 1995). In the United States, chefs and food enthusiasts with similar backgrounds and reduced start-up costs can account for over 20,000 trucks, generating nearly $650 million dollars in sales (Sacks, 2011). One of the biggest challenges for food truck survival is creating awareness and interest via advertising, recognizing a severe lack of experience and resources compared to restaurant chains (Miller R. , 2012). This paper will build on previous research that suggests that successful web advertisements have a positive effect on purchase intentions (Hwang, Yoon, & Park, 2011), assuming the perceived benefits carry over to the food truck industry. Also, further investigation will be conducted to determine the most appropriate audience and advertisement style. The ultimate goal of this proposed research is to provide a plausible advertising strategy for small business owners who presumably do not have an extensive background in advertising. While food can act as a reinforcement of ethnic ties, it can also provide a passive yet enjoyable method of integration and inclusion of nonindigenous cultures. The continued success of street food in the United States could have implications far beyond a source of revenue, which is the underlying purpose of this paper. LITERATURE REVIEW: According to Acho-Chi, street food service points have become \u201cempowering public sites for social networking where people relax, tell stories, brag, and discuss politics, sports and business ventures. As such, street food selling and consumption have become synonymous with expressions of sharing and conviviality\u201d (Acho-Chi, 2002, p. 136). This positive determination of street food is shared by Romano who claims, \u201cthe deeper hunger that's driving the street-food trend\u2014the desire to reach out and connect with a globalized world that we're more aware of and reliant on than ever\u2014is worth celebrating\u201d (Romano, 2011, p. 54). Street food in the United States allows us to indulge in cross-culture experimentation and socialization for a fraction of the cost one would pay at a standard sit-down restaurant. The barrier to continued success for street food in the United States does not appear to be an aversion to new cultures. Americans have often suspended traditional racial prejudices and opened themselves to a range of diverse culinary and cultural experiences (Barbas, 2003). The more relevant obstacle facing street food is expanding its customer base. This would include potential customers who are not proactive in the search of mobile food trucks, particularly for dining destinations with little visibility or brand awareness. The most difficult aspect of this endeavor is to produce effective advertising with a severely limited budget. Although it has been postulated that only a third of all advertising campaigns show an immediate and significant influence on sales for restaurant franchises (Herrington, 2010), advertising for restaurants continues to accrue billions of dollars annually. As the users of social networks grow past a billion, restaurants are using social media to obtain feedback on menu offerings, communicate with customers, and increase traffic via contests and giveaways. DiPietro et al. conducted a study to measure how chain restaurants use Facebook, Twitter, and FishBowl (DiPietro, Crews, Gustafson, & Strick, 2012). One of the interesting findings was that respondents cited people under the age of thirty-five to be the most appropriate age group to be reached via social media. A study conducted by Hyun et al. provided findings on evaluative advertising dimensions (Hyun, Kim, & Lee, 2011), suggesting that advertising that contained relevant news, entertainment factors, and a sense of familiarity positively influenced purchase behavior. According to Hwang et al. (2011), effective website design for casual-dining restaurants can contribute to building brands and future purchases, and if web visitors like the websites of particular restaurants, they are more likely to visit those restaurants. Previous research has also shown that significant others can be especially powerful elicitors of normative thoughts and behavior (Stapel, Joly, & Lindenberg, 2010). Furthermore, thinking of significant others is likely to activate the norms, attitudes, opinions, and behaviors they are associated with (Van Knippenberg, 1992). For these reasons, social media has in many ways replaced interaction and word-of-mouth advertising, and has thus become a very powerful advertising tool (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh, & Gremier, 2004). Social media has been studied extensively in terms of how it can be used for effective advertising for restaurants, particularly large restaurant chains (DiPietro, Crews, Gustafson, & Strick, 2012). However, research focused on utilizing social media for advertising street food trucks is currently lacking. METHODS: To determine the usage of social media as an advertising outlet, surveys (similar to Dipeitro\u2019s model) will be administered randomly to street food truck purveyors in a twelve mile radius of Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas on random days of randomly chosen months. The location was chosen because of its established reputation for housing several street food trucks (Austin boasts over 1,000 food trucks for the 1.7+ million residents). An additional survey will be constructed and administered to measure advertising awareness and usage of street food trucks, as well as demographic information pertinent to the study. In addition, the content of any advertisement recalled will be recorded. This survey will incorporate validated measurement tools that have been previously discussed, particularly those by Hyun et al. and Hwang et al. The distribution of the survey will be random. One of the criteria for selection will be that the respondent live in a ten mile radius of a proximity recognized as having street food truck operations (operationalized with a dummy variable \u201cDo you live within ten miles of a food truck\u201d). Analyses will be conducted to determine (1) if street food vendors are currently utilizing social media for the purpose of advertising, (2) whether social media influences certain demographic groups like gender and age, and (3) if advertising via social media influences behavioral intentions to purchase street food. The resultant hypotheses are thus: H1: Advertising via social media is not currently utilized by the majority of street food vendors interviewed. H2: The importance of advertising via social media will be positively influenced by age of street food patrons. H3: Social media advertising positively influences street food patrons\u2019 behavioral intentions. H4: Favorable social media advertising for current non-users of street food under the age of 35 will positively influence future purchases EXPECTED IMPLICATIONS: The majority of street food trucks vendors lack the extensive marketing backgrounds, as well as the capital to invest in traditional advertising outlets (Zukin, 1995). In addition, social media advertising is not currently utilized by the majority of street food vendors (Herrington, 2010). However, research indicates that social media is rapidly gaining popularity within the food industry as a cost efficient and positively influential advertising tool. Increasing the exposure of street food should increase the likelihood of increased usage of street food. This study will help determine the usage of social media as an advertising tool among street food purveyors. Establishing usage levels among street food purveyors will help determine if (1) street food purveyors are taking advantage of a powerful advertising tool and (2) m", "year": 2016}

Disentangling position bias from status quo effects", "abstract": "The way in which individuals perceive different goods has repeatedly been shown to be affected by the physical ordering of goods in a given choice situation (see Campbell and Erdem (2015) for a recent review). Horizontally, products positioned in the center of the shelf are often perceived as more popular (Valenzuela and Raghubir, 2009), and persons in a central position perceived as being more important (Raghubir and Valenzuela, 2006). Within stated preference and Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE) a left-right bias has been reported by a few studies (Scarpa et al. 2011, Matthews et al. 2016), where alternatives positioned to the left are chosen more frequently compared to alternatives positioned to the right, irrespectively of the attribute levels. This has been explained by primacy effects, where items examined first are subjected to deeper cognitive processing, and establish a baseline against which the other alternatives are compared (Krosnick, 1999). Thus, in cultures where individuals read from left to right, this would entail a bias towards the leftmost alternative. Vertically, where metaphors such as \u201con top of things\u201d and \u201chitting rock bottom\u201d are widely used in daily life, a position bias where products and items located at the top are perceived as better compared to products place lower, has been well documented in the marketing and psychology literature (Meier et al. 2007, Chandon et al. 2009). The top-bottom bias has also been found to affect choices in a best-worst scaling study by Campbell and Erdem (2015), where trust in different institutions not only depended on the institution itself, but also on its position in the choice task. With the growing evidence of both vertical and horizontal position biases from neighboring strands of literature, it is somewhat surprising that position bias has received relatively limited attention in the DCE literature. In an unlabeled DCE, horizontal position bias is usually accounted for by specifying alternative specific constants for n-1 alternatives. However, for the results from DCEs to be consistent with welfare economics, one of the alternatives in the choice set has to be the no-buy or status quo (SQ) alternative. If the position of this alternative is not varied throughout the choice sets, the resulting alternative specific constants will confound potential status quo effects with the position bias. Randomizing the location of the SQ alternative allows for the independent estimation of a SQ effect as well as any position bias, however, this is not normally done. In a recent study where the position of the alternatives is randomized, Matthews et al. (2016) find a left to right bias but no SQ effect. However, as their experimental setup does not include a treatment where the position of the alternatives is not randomized, it is not possible to properly test the convergent validity, and the question regarding the actual impact of the randomization is thus left unanswered. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, such a comparison does not appear in the DCE literature, despite the obvious implications for the design of stated preference experiments. Apart from affecting the size of the SQ effect, we hypothesize that randomizing the location of the SQ alternative will encourage respondents to make more informed choices, as the opportunity for using simplifying decision heuristics assisted by the position of the alternatives is removed. A respondent using a heuristic, such as always choosing the SQ or cheapest alternative, would have to actively find this alternative in every choice set, rather than using position as a cue, and in the process have to attend to information in other alternatives. On the other hand, it might also make the choice task more complex and thus confuse respondents, increasing the noise in the data. This paper focuses on the effects caused by varying the position of the SQ alternative in a DCE. We do this with three treatments: one where the position of the SQ alternative is to the left in a three alternative choice set, one where the SQ alternative is to the right, and one where the position of the SQ is randomized. The data is based on a DCE concerning preferences for different riparian buffer strip (i.e., the interface between land and a river or stream) policies in Denmark, and consists of roughly 260 respondents in each of the three treatments. We present and compare estimates based on the three treatment samples, as well as investigate the effect that the position of the SQ alternative has by looking at the differences in scale and consideration sets between treatments. To do so, we jointly estimate an independent availability logit with scale adjusted latent classes and random parameters. The results indicate that randomizing the position of the SQ alternative has the effect of \u2018nudging\u2019 respondents away from using simplifying decision heuristics, such as only choosing the SQ alternative or any of the two experimentally created alternatives. Furthermore, we find evidence that randomizing the position of the SQ alternative reduces the SQ effect, which leads us to believe that some of what has previously been labelled as a status quo effect may in fact be a result of position bias.

First and first, it's important to comprehend the target audience and their preferences. In order to better understand client demands, expectations, and purchasing patterns, firms can modify their platforms and marketing initiatives by doing market research and utilising data analytics. Second, it is crucial to design an interface that is simple and easy to use. To improve the customer experience, the e-commerce platform should offer easy navigation, simple search features, and simplified checkout procedures. Given the increased popularity of mobile shopping, investing in adaptable design and mobile optimisation is also essential. Thirdly, merchandising and product display are crucial in promoting sales. The many methods and processes used to create and expand prosperous online enterprises are referred to as ecommerce development strategies. These methods cover everything from creating an online store to generating traffic, improving conversion rates, and guaranteeing customer pleasure. Ecommerce companies can better understand their target market by conducting research on consumer preferences, behaviour, and trends. Businesses can use market research to determine the requirements and preferences of potential customers, which can inform decisions about what products to offer at what prices, and how to best sell their services. Businesses can study their rivals' plans, strengths, and weaknesses through research to learn more about them. Depending on how closely a set of options fit an ideal answer, they are assessed and ranked using a decision-making method known as TOPSIS, or Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal response. It is a method for MCDA (multi-criteria decision analysis), which aids individuals or groups in making decisions by taking a variety of preferences and considerations into account. The TOPSIS strategy aids decision-makers in methodically analysing and contrasting choices based on a variety of factors while taking their preferences and priorities into consideration. It increases transparency and comprehension of the decision-making process and offers a systematic strategy to enhance decision-making. Alternative Parameters: E-customization and personalization, Social E-commerce adoption model, Strong search engine optimization (SEO) Evaluate parameter: Feasibility of the strategy, Implementation speed, Compliance with the corporate strategy, Compliance of the strategy with the mission and vision of the company, General acceptance The evaluation criteria may also include the following additional factors: general acceptance, speed of implementation, compliance with corporate strategy, e-customization and personalization, social search engine optimisation, and compliance with the strategy's mission and vision The effective application of these tactics will enable firms to build a strong online presence, boost customer happiness, and enhance income in a cutthroat e-commerce industry. Businesses must adapt and hone their tactics to stay ahead of the curve as consumer preferences and technology change. Businesses may stay successful in the dynamic world of e-commerce by embracing innovation, knowing their customers, and keeping up with market trends.", "year": 2023}

Although healthcare usability professionals and healthcare organizations should continue to adopt design and research practice from industry standards, we should also continue to seek out human-centered research (e.g., psychology, cognitive neuroscience) and integrate new research findings as a key part of our understanding of best practices. We should strive to identify basic (as opposed to applied) research that can be used to augment and improve regulatory guidance as we develop more effective methodologies and advance our field. Academia has a history of struggling to disseminate findings throughout relevant industries, and healthcare is no exception. However, human factors practitioners are well positioned to serve as the bridge between basic, human-centered research findings and the medical device/healthcare industry. Without such a bridge, a delay occurs between scientific discoveries surrounding human cognitive capacity and their application in the real world (i.e., medical devices and medical environments). Such a delay stagnates progress in applied research and design techniques, including usability testing, root cause probing, user experience design, and risk mitigation. This article seeks to address a specific area of human-centered research and its application in user experience, usability, and human factors practice: the evolving understanding of human attentional capacity and how usability engineering practices can leverage that understanding when designing and developing medical devices. The author asserts the following: 1. Scientific literature investigating attention and cognitive control provides valuable information that we, as an industry, can apply to usability research and device design. 2 Medical device users regularly use devices in low-cognitive resource states, decreasing the attention they\u2019re able to pay to device interactions, increasing risk of error. 3. Attention-related risk in device interaction is identifiable and mitigable using techniques, such as the perception-cognition-action (PCA) analysis and usability testing. 4. To mitigate risk related to inattention, medical device development teams should use \u201clow-demand design,\u201d which seeks to facilitate safe and effective use for low-resource cognition, rather than demanding that users allocate more resources to a feature, warning, or task. a. Rather than just keeping interfaces simple, understanding and identifying intended user groups\u2019 preconceptions (e.g., mental models, automatic thought patterns) and limitations (e.g., finite resources) also is important. b. Understanding these facets of user cognition can help in designing complex devices and environments that ask less of the user and allow them to function within their limitations, without increasing risk.", "year": 2020}
{"paperId": "570ce3953f546f1802c988693700b907659a91bc", "title": "Dialogical strategies of science communicators (Science Communication)", "abstract": "According to Taylor et al. (2001), dialogue can be defined \"as a tool for effective and mutually rewarding interpersonal communication\" (p. 267) and refers to \u201cany negotiated exchange of ideas and opinions\u201d (Kent & Taylor, 1998, p. 325), whereby all parties in a relationship strive to engage in an honest, open and ethically communicative give and take (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009). From a public relations perspective, dialogue is a necessary tool to build an effective relationship with the public (Kent & Taylor, 1998). Dialogical strategies therefore serve to build and maintain dynamic and lasting relationships with publics (Kent & Taylor, 1998).\nField of application/theoretical foundation:\nMany studies investigating the dialogical strategies of organizations on the Internet refer in terms of their theoretical foundation to the preliminary work of Kent and Taylor (1998) and Taylor et al. (2001) (e. g. Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Yang & Taylor, 2010). Kent and Taylor (1998) developed five dimensions, so-called \u201cprinciples of dialogue\u201d (Taylor et al., 2001, p. 269), which can be utilized by organizations in their strategically designed websites in order to engage in dialogical relationships Among these principles are:\n\nEase of interface: This point refers to the usability of a site which is a prerequisite for online dialogue. If visitors do not have an easy time navigating a site and finding information, they will not have a positive experience at the website and may not use it again.\nUsefulness of information: This principle is relevant because it clarifies the reason for visiting a website. Visitors turn to a site when it provides them with information that is useful, trustworthy, and of lasting value.\nConservation of visitors: The goal of websites should be to keep visitors on their own site and not to encourage them to visit other sites, e. g. through advertisements.\nGeneration of return visits: A relationship can only be established by users who are encouraged to return and visit the website on a regular basis.\nDialogic loop: Websites have to offer two-way communication (interactivity) in order to be fully dialogic.\n\n\u00a0\nOther studies adapted the theoretical framework and modified it for application to different research objects such as social media platforms (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Yang & Taylor, 2010). For instance, the study by Bortree & Seltzer (2009) extended it by adding organization engagement as a new strategy, since organizations can also encourage dialogue via posts on their own sites (e. g. walls and discussion boards). Besides the dialogic strategies, their outcomes are often identified and coded as well.\nExample studies:\nBortree & Seltzer (2009); Cho et al. (2014); Reber & Kim (2006); Taylor et al.

{"paperId": "57383e21174271257e6059d83f7d3d57bc81dd03", "title": "High Level Applications for Sirius Accelerators Control", "abstract": "Sirius is a 4th generation 3 GeV synchrotron light source that has just finalised the first commissioning phase at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) campus in Campinas, Brazil. The large number of process variables and large complexity of the subsystems in this type of machine requires the development of tools to simplify the commissioning and operation of the accelerators. This paper describes some of the high level control tools developed for the accelerators commissioning and future operation. INTRODUCTION Sirius is the new 4th generation synchrotron light source built by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM), in Campinas, Brazil. The machine consists of a 150 MeV Linac, built by SINAP [1], a full-energy Booster and a 3 GeV storage ring, designed with a multi-bendachromat approach to reach the emittance of 250 pm rad [2]. The first phase of Sirius commissioning has just finalized and its first beamlines are coming into operation [3]. Some experiments by internal and external users were already registered. Since mid 2020, the machine has been operating in decay mode, with two injections per day, for beamline commissioning. In January 2021, there was a girders alignment campaign in all accelerators, which required a new commissioning in February. Since early April 2021, it has been operated with an initial current of 70 mA. Some of the activities scheduled for this year are the first tests with top-up operation, fast orbit feedback (FOFB) system and orbit interlock implementation and some new beamlines installation. In this article, we will present the high-level control tools that have been developed and used for machine commissioning and future operation. The following sections will bring an overview of the control system (CS) and its support applications used and describe the high-level applications (HLA) available, such as: services to record and consult the machine\u2019s history and state, as well as CS constants information; the generic analysis applications most used for experiments and diagnostics; and, finally, specialized applications for monitoring and controlling subsystems and physical parameters. CONTROL SYSTEM OVERVIEW Sirius accelerators are composed of several subsystems, most of them controlled through an EPICS [4] communication architecture, more specifically the version R3.15. \u2217 ana.clara@lnls.br The control of accelerator devices involves using around 500 device and soft input/output controllers (IOC), which run in 10 servers monitored with the help of Zabbix [5] service. Besides others support applications, these IOCs are distributed in 113 docker stacks and 325 containers, which are managed with the Portainer [6] tool. Through these IOC, a wide variety of machine parameters are configured and monitored through around 150 thousands of process variables (PV), number that is expected to increase after the integration of some subsystems to the architecture and the insertion of new devices to the machine. In order to control all these PVs in the most intuitive and effective way, so as to complete commissioning tasks and achieve design parameters, a wide variety of HLA has been developed in-house in a collaborative way, mostly using the GitHub [7] and GitLab source version control platforms, with open-source tools. In the EPICS community, there are many choices for high-level application development tools, which have been well deployed on Sirius, both on the EPICS server [8] and client sides. Configuration of control room desktop computers, service docker image and containers are managed with Ansible automation tool [9]. The open-source package management tool Conda [10] has also been applied to manage environment and dependencies of HLA. RECORDING AND SHARING SERVICES We have been using an instance of the EPICS Archiver Appliance [11] to record the PVs history. Besides the standard archiver maintenance tool, another PV management tool has been developed in-house to simplify and speed up the handling of large volumes of PVs. EPICS Archiver has a Viewer application, also developed in-house [12]. It is a web interface, implemented with TypeScript [13], using JavaScript libraries such as React [14] and Redux [15]. The viewer, which is shown in Fig. 1, is a tool used daily for monitoring and faults diagnosis, which has been quite efficient for history visualization, with very useful features such as zoom, scale and limit adjustments.

These packages have been improved throughout the development of analysis tools and machine performance reports. To register the machine states and also to retrieve known configurations, we have the in-house developed configuration service, called ConfigDB. The service consists of a Flask [16] server, with REST protocol, which manages a mongoDB [17] database, and has a python API, which uses the PyMongo [18] library. On the client side, we also have a small python layer. It was a service developed to provide flexibility about the type of the data that can be registered and easy to extend. New types of configuration can be defined at any time, which can be available to be used after a task as simple as defining a template in a python file. The two most commonly used types of configuration are machine snapshots and correction parameter configurations, such as orbit response matrices. The service is accompanied by graphical user interfaces (GUI), based on PyQt5 [19], for consulting configurations data, saving and applying new snapshots. For those, the interfaces use the PyEpics [20] library. Figure 2 shows a GUI for applying a configuration. It has a PV selection tool, with a tree view with division logic based on the Sirius naming system [2,21], which make it easy to apply a partial state. Figure 2: ConfigDB Apply GUI. To ensure the synchronization of CS constants information in all applications, such as magnet excitation curves, device positioning and low level communication architecture details, we have a static table server available via http Apache [22]. For each table, there is a simple python layer for convenient availability of the data, developed in order to allow multiple simultaneous queries to the data and to minimize the queries to the server. The service is used both by device (power supplies) and soft IOCs (high level timing), as well as by GUI implemented to control these subsystems. For recording and sharing machine study data, the control room desktops are connected in a network scalable filesystem structure. We recently migrated this sharing scheme from NFS to GlusterFS [23]. ANALYSIS AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS A variety of generic tools for visualization and analysis are available in the control room desktops. The most used tool for PV history visualization and monitoring is the Archiver Viewer, presented in the previous section. Another visualization tool used in operation activities is the software Igor Pro [24], an initiative by WaveMetrics, that runs in Windows. The software was widely used in the UVX, the first synchrotron light source built by LNLS, and was adapted to communicate with the Archiver Appliance. It is a very interesting tool that brings options such as easy macro development, several markers, with options to check differences between selected points. Currently, the LNLS operation group has been working to provide more options for data visualization, such as history comparisons of parameters at different time intervals. An alternative and simple tool that we keep available on the control room desktops is the TimeChart [25] viewer, an initiative by the same developers from PyDM [26] project. It allows online time tracking of several PVs and it is interesting for scanning experiments. The tool that has been most used for machine studies is, undoubtedly, Jupyter Notebook [27]. Python notebooks with scripts and generic analysis, such as response matrices and betatron function measurements, are organized in the file sharing service and replicated for the various experiments. The python environment, with libraries like Numpy [28] and SciPy [29], for data processing, and Matplotlib [30], for data visualization, has proven to be very useful, versatile and robust for several types of analysis. The development of tools to integrate the characterization study scripts with the CS has been extensively explored by the accelerator physics group. Throughout the Sirius project, the group worked on the implementation of simulation libraries, in c++ and python languages. Recently, a great effort has been made to expand and improve these tools to integrate them with the CS. This integration, of simulation and CS interaction environments in the same language, greatly facilitates the development of new tools and has made it possible to implement more complex analysis, such as the LOCO algorithm [31], for the machine linear optics studies, and beam position monitors (BPM) turn-by-turn (TbT) data analysis, for estimates of equilibrium parameters and nonlinear optics [32]. As secondary tools, Matlab [33] and Octave [34] are also available on the control desktops, as well as the AT [35] simulation environment, prepared for EPICS communication through LabCA [36] and MCA [37] librari", "year": 2021}

In recent years, with the development of hardware technology, virtual reality technology has been widely used in games, entertainment, medical and other civilian fields. In the field of civil aircraft, virtual reality technology mainly focuses on simulated flight, cockpit pilot training, aircraft maintenance training, etc. This article proposes a customer-oriented aircraft virtual scene design and implementation method, and describes the design process from aircraft 3D model construction, lightweight processing, virtual scene rendering, and WebRTC-based wireless video streaming. The main technical difficulties solved in this paper include two parts: one is to convert the existing aircraft 3D engineering model into a polygonal model that can be used for VR rendering, and the other is to realize the problem of multi-user online interactive access to virtual scenes. Through this system, users can do engineering evaluation and experience evaluation during the whole process of aircraft product design, development and sales. The application scenarios designed in this paper further expand the application of virtual reality technology in the field of civil aircraft development and lay the foundation for the development of more application scenarios in the future.", "year": 2021}

They characterize the physical world and generate a continuous flow of sensory interactions. In this age of mass production, engineers and designers are in a unique position to use the opportunities presented by materials development and apply them in creative ways to trigger meaningful user experiences. \nDynamism is considered a very promising material experience in terms of creating meaningful interactions, and, consequently, user attachment to a product (Rognoli, Ferrara and Arquilla 2016). Dynamic products are those that show sensory features that change over time in a proactive and reversible way, activating one or more user\u2019s sensory modalities and aiming at enhancing the user\u2019s experience (Colombo 2016). \nSmart materials could be considered the most suitable candidates to provide dynamic experiences. They react to external stimuli, such as pressure, temperature or the electric field, changing properties such as shape or colour. They are capable of both sensing and responding to the environment, as well as exerting active control of their responses (Addington and Schodek 2004). Compared to understanding traditional materials, smart materials involve additional technical complexity. \nThe aim of this paper is to share how the Material Driven Design (MDD) method (Karana et al. 2015) has been applied and to analyse a set of 10 projects, grouped into 5 case studies, developed by students from ELISAVA over the last 3 years to improve ways to implement the method. We have analysed the case studies in terms of the changes observed in the sensory features, using a sensory map proposed by Sara Colombo (Colombo 2016). By comparing different projects, the paper shows how the sensorial aspects are invoked by different smart material properties. \nThe 5 case studies have integrated the smart materials into functional prototypes for different application sectors, such as healthcare, energy harvesting or fashion. We have found that only three sensory modalities (sound, sight and touch) were involved in the user experience, with sight being the most predominant sensory perception. \nThis study aims to serve as a springboard for other scholars interested in designing dynamic products with smart materials.", "year": 2018}

Translating this versatile interaction technique to Augmented Reality (AR) can provide interaction designers with more opportunities to implement more intuitive and realistic AR applications. The work presented in this thesis uses quantifiable measures to evaluate the accuracy and usability of natural grasping of virtual objects in AR environments, and presents methods for improving this natural form of interaction. \nFollowing a review of physical grasping parameters and current methods of mediating grasping interactions in AR, a comprehensive analysis of natural freehand grasping of virtual objects in AR is presented to assess the accuracy, usability and transferability of this natural form of grasping to AR environments. The analysis is presented in four independent user studies (120 participants, 30 participants for each study and 5760 grasping tasks in total), where natural freehand grasping performance is assessed for a range of virtual object sizes, positions and types in terms of accuracy of grasping, task completion time and overall system usability. \nFindings from the first user study in this work highlighted two key problems for natural grasping in AR; namely inaccurate depth estimation and inaccurate size estimation of virtual objects. \nFollowing the quantification of these errors, three different methods for mitigating user errors and assisting users during natural grasping were presented and analysed; namely dual view visual feedback, drop shadows and additional visual feedback when adding user based tolerances during interaction tasks. Dual view visual feedback was found to significantly improve user depth estimation, however this method also significantly increased task completion time. \nDrop shadows provided an alternative, and a more usable solution, to dual view visual feedback through significantly improving depth estimation, task completion time and the overall usability of natural grasping. User based tolerances negated the fundamental problem of inaccurate size estimation of virtual objects, through enabling users to perform natural grasping without the need of being highly accurate in their grasping performance, thus providing evidence that natural grasping can be usable in task based AR environments. Finally recommendations for allowing and further improving natural grasping interaction in AR environments are provided, along with guidelines for translating this form of natural grasping to other AR environments and user interfaces.", "year": 2018}

Results from the user studies suggest that performance is improved when the robot assumes some of the navigational responsibilities or the interface presents spatial information as it relates to the pose of the robot in the remote environment. The authors hope that understanding the roles of intelligence and interface design when operating a remote robot will lead to improved humanrobot teams that are useful in a variety of tasks.

Introduction Robots have been used in a variety of settings where human access is difficult, impractical, or dangerous. These settings include search and rescue, space exploration, toxic site cleanup, reconnaissance, patrols, and many others (Murphy, 2004). Often, when a robot is used in one of these conditions, the robot is distant from the operator; this is referred to as teleoperation. Ideally, robots could be a useful member of a team because they could be used to accomplish tasks that might be too difficult or impractical for a human to perform. The potential, however, for humans and robots to work as an effective team is limited by the lack of an appropriate means for the operator to visualize the remote environment and how the robot fits within the environment. As an example, several recent research efforts have investigated the human-robot interaction challenges associated with real-world operations including search and rescue and remote characterization of high-radiation environments (Burke, Murphy, Coovert, & Riddle, 2004; Casper & Murphy, 2003; Murphy, 2004; Yanco, Drury, & Scholtz, 2004a). Across these disparate domains, researchers have noted that it is difficult for operators to navigate a remote robot due to difficulty and error in operator understanding of the robot\u2019s position and/or perspective within the remote environment. A primary reason for the difficulty in remote robot teleoperation is that for the overwhelming majority of robotic operations, video remains the primary means of providing information from the remote environment to the operator (Burke, Murphy, Rogers, Lumelsky, & Scholtz, 2004a). Woods, Tittle, Feil, and Roesler (2004) describe the process of using video to navigate a robot as attempting to drive while looking through a \u201csoda straw\u201d because of the limited angular view associated with the camera (Woods et al., 2004). The limited angular view of the camera presents problems for robot teleoperation because obstacles outside of the field of view of the camera still pose navigational threats to the robot even though they are not visible to the operator. To alleviate navigational threats to the robot, current research at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is aimed at providing tools that support mixed-initiative control where humans and robots are able to make decisions and take initiative to accomplish a task. The goal is to create a set of capabilities that permit robots to be viewed as trusted teammates rather than passive tools. If this is to happen, the robot as well as the human must be enabled to reason spatially about the task and environment. Furthermore, true teamwork requires a shared understanding of the environment and task between team members in order to understand each others\u2019 intentions (Dennett, 1981). The lack of an effective shared understanding has been a significant impediment to having humans and intelligent robots work together. In response to this challenge, the INL has developed a mixed-initiative robot control architecture that provides a framework for robot intelligence, environment mod21 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the \"Add to Cart\" button on the", "year": 2019}

Methods \u2013 A thematic analysis of literature gaps and a descriptive case study illustrated participants\u2019 co-production experiences. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers (n = 3), middle managers (n = 5), and clinical leads (n = 5). Service users were not included in the sample to reflect the design of the model adopted by the Trust. Verification interviews supported the credibility of emerging underlying thematically analysed themes. Findings \u2013 The following five themes emerged: corporate machine, continual revolution, power, interface, and attitudes to co-production. The analysis found that organisational culture impeded co-production, with significant knowledge gaps present which hindered effective co-production.

{"paperId": "5a09144cc649e884bba58b05f7aebff66fa6e775", "title": "Making Light of Convicts", "abstract": "Introduction\nThe social roles of alcohol consumption are rich and varied, with different types of alcoholic beverages reflecting important symbolic and cultural meanings. Sparkling wine is especially notable for its association with secular and sacred celebrations. Indeed, sparkling wine is rarely drunk as a matter of routine; bottles of such wine signal special occasions, heightened by the formality and excitement associated with opening the bottle and controlling (or not!) the resultant fizz (Faith).\nOriginating in England and France in the late 1600s, sparkling wine marked a dramatic shift in winemaking techniques, with winemakers deliberately adding \u201cfizz\u201d or bubbles to their product (Faith). The resulting effervescent wines were first enjoyed by the social elite of European society, signifying privilege, wealth, luxury and nobility; however, new techniques for producing, selling and distributing the wines created a mass consumer culture (Guy).\nProduction of Australian sparkling wines began in the late nineteenth\u00a0century and consumption remains popular. As a \u201cnew world\u201d country \u2013 that is, one not located in the wine producing areas of Europe \u2013 Australian sparkling wines cannot directly draw on the same marketing traditions as those of the \u201cold world\u201d. One enterprising company, Treasury Wine Estates, markets a range of wines, including a sparkling variety, called 19 Crimes, that draws, not on European traditions tied to luxury, wealth and prestige, but Australia\u2019s colonial history.\u00a0\nUsing Augmented Reality and interactive story-telling, 19 Crimes wine labels feature convicts who had committed one or more of 19 crimes punishable by transportation to Australia from Britain. The marketing of sparkling wine using convict images and convict stories of transportation have not diminished the celebratory role of consuming \u201cbubbly\u201d. Rather, in exploring the marketing techniques employed by the company, particularly when linked to the traditional drink of celebration, we argue that 19 Crimes, while fun and informative, nevertheless romanticises convict experiences and Australia\u2019s convict past.\nConvict Heritage and Re-Appropriating the Convict Image\nAustralia\u2019s cultural heritage is undeniably linked to its convict past. Convicts were transported to Australia from England and Ireland over an 80-year period between 1788-1868. While the convict system in Australia was not predominantly characterised by incarceration and institutionalisation (Jones 18) the work they performed was often forced and physically taxing, and food and clothing shortages were common. Transportation meant exile, and \u201cit was a fierce punishment that ejected men, women and children from their homelands into distant and unknown territories\u201d (Bogle 23).\u00a0\nConvict experiences of transportation often varied and were dependent not just on the offender themselves (for example their original crime, how willing they were to work and their behaviour), but also upon the location they were sent to. \u201cNormal\u201d punishment could include solitary confinement, physical reprimands (flogging) or hard labour in chain gangs.\nFrom the time that transportation ceased in the mid 1800s, efforts were made to distance Australia\u2019s future from the \u201cconvict stain\u201d of its past (Jones). Many convict establishments were dismantled or repurposed with the intent of forgetting the past, although some became sites of tourist visitation from the time of closure.\nImportantly, however, the wider political and social reluctance to engage in discourse regarding Australia\u2019s \u201cunsavoury historical incident\u201d of its convict past continued up until the 1970s (Jones 26). During the 1970s Australia\u2019s convict heritage began to be discussed more openly, and indeed, more favourably (Welch 597). Many today now view Australia\u2019s convicts as \u201creluctant pioneers\u201d (Barnard 7), and as such they are celebrated within our history. In short, the convict heritage is now something to be celebrated rather than shunned. This celebration has been capitalised upon by tourist industries and more recently by wine label 19 Crimes.\u00a0\n\u201c19 Crimes: Cheers to the Infamous\u201d\nThe Treasury Wine Estates brand launched 19 Crimes in 2011 to a target population of young men aged between 18 and 34 (Lyons). Two limited edition vintages sold out in 2011 with \u201cvirtually no promotion\u201d (19 Crimes, \u201cCanadians\u201d). In 2017, 19 Crimes became the first wine to use an Augmented Reality (AR) app (the app was later renamed Living Wines Labels in 2018) that allowed customers\n\nto hover their [smart] phone in front of a bottle of the wine and [watch] mugshots of infamous 18th\u00a0century British criminals come to life as 3D characters who recount\u00a0their side of the story. Having committed at least one of the 19 crimes punishable by exile to Australia, these convicts now humor and delight wine drinkers across the globe. (Lirie)\n\nGiven the target audience of the 19 Crimes wine was already 18-34 year old males, AR made sense as a marketing technique. Advertisers are well aware the millennial generation is \u201cdigitally empowered\u201d and the AR experience was created to not only allow \u201cconsumers to engage with 19 Crimes wines but also explore some of the stories of Australia\u2019s convict past \u2026 [as] told by the convicts-turned-colonists themselves!\u201d (Lilley cited in Szentpeteri 1-2). The strategy encourages people to collect convicts by purchasing other 19 Crimes alcohol to experience a wider range of stories.\nThe AR has been highly praised:\n\nthey [the labels] animate, explaining just what went down and giving a richer experience to your beverage; engaging both the mind and the taste buds simultaneously \u2026 . \u2018A fantastic app that brings a little piece of history to life\u2019, writes one user on the Apple app store. \u2018I jumped out of my skin when the mugshot spoke to me\u2019. (Stone)\n\nFrom here, the success of 19 Crimes has been widespread. For example, in November 2020, media reports indicated that 19 Crimes red wine was the most popular supermarket wine in the UK (Lyons; Pearson-Jones). During the UK COVID lockdown in 2020, 19 Crimes sales increased by 148 per cent in volume (Pearson-Jones). This success is in no small part to its innovative marketing techniques, which of course includes the AR technology heralded as a way to enhance the customer experience (Lirie).\nThe 19 Crimes wine label explicitly celebrates infamous convicts turned settlers. The website \u201c19 Crimes: Cheers to the Infamous\u201d incorporates ideas of celebration, champagne and bubbles by encouraging people to toast their mates:\n\nthe convicts on our wines are not fiction. They were of flesh and blood, criminals and scholars. Their punishment of transportation should have shattered their spirits. Instead, it forged a bond stronger than steel. Raise a glass to our convict past and the principles these brave men and women lived by. (19 Crimes, \u201cCheers\u201d)\n\nWhile using alcohol, and in particular sparkling wine, to participate in a toasting ritual is the \u201cnorm\u201d for many social situations, what is distinctive about the 19 Crimes label is that they have chosen to merchandise and market known offenders for individuals to encounter and collect as part of their drinking entertainment. This is an innovative and highly popular concept. According to one marketing company: \u201c19 Crimes Wines celebrate the rebellious spirit of the more than 160,000 exiled men and women, the rule breakers and law defying citizens that forged a new culture and national spirit in Australia\u201d (Social Playground). The implication is that by drinking this brand of [sparkling] wine, consumers are also partaking in celebrating those convicts who \u201cforged\u201d Australian culture and national spirit.\nIn many ways, this is not a \u201cbad thing\u201d. 19 Crimes are promoting Australian cultural history in unique ways and on a very public and international scale. The wine also recognises the hard work and success stories of the many convicts that did indeed build Australia. Further, 19 Crimes are not intentionally minimising the experiences of convicts. They implicitly acknowledge the distress felt by convicts noting that it \u201cshould have shattered their spirits\u201d. However, at times, the narratives and marketing tools romanticise the convict experience and culturally reinterpret a difficult experience into one of novelty. They also tap into Australia\u2019s embracement of larrikinism. In many ways, 19 Crimes are encouraging consumers to participate in larrikin behaviour, which Bellanta identifies as being irreverent, mocking authority, showing a disrespect for social subtleties and engaging in boisterous drunkenness with mates. Celebrating convict history with a glass of bubbly certainly mocks authority, as does participating in cultural practices that subvert original intentions.\u00a0\nSeveral companies in the US and Europe are now reportedly offering the service of selling wine bottle labels with customisable mugshots. Journalist Legaspi suggests that the perfect gift for anyone who wants a sparkling wine or cider to toast with during the Yuletide season would be having a customisable mugshot as a wine bottle label. The label comes with the person\u2019s mugshot along with a \u201cgoofy \u2018crime\u2019 that fits the person-appealing\u201d (Sotelo cited in Legaspi). In 2019, Social Playground partnered with MAAKE and Dan Murphy's stores around Australia to offer customers their own personalised sticker mugshots that could be added to the wine bottles. The campaign was intended to drive awareness of 19 Crimes, and mugshot photo areas were set up in each store. Customers could then pose for a photo against the \u201cmug shot style backdrop. Each photo was treated with custom filters to match the wine labels actual packaging\u201d and then printed on a sticker (Social Playground).\n\nThe result was a fun photo moment, delivered as a personalised experience. Shoppers were encouraged to purchase the product to personalise their bottle, with hundreds of consumers taking up the offer.\nWith instant SMS delivery, consumers also rec", "year": 2021}

AR and VR applications greatly benefit from a high degree of immersion that includes consistent visualization and intuitive interaction with the virtual content. Head-mounted displays (HMDs), in particular optical-see-through (OST) HMDs, provide a natural interface for the presentation of AR. However, despite greatly improved design and years of research on OST-HMDs and AR, current systems still suffer from a variety of problems, such as complicated interaction, color inconsistencies and manual calibration. We expect that with further development of OST-HMDs, eye-tracking cameras will become an integral part of the device. Existing methods in eye detection use either eye features, e.g., the contour of the iris, or reflection of known light sources, commonly infra-red (IR) light emitting diodes (LEDs), to recover the position of the eye. Although the latter allow for high accuracy their use is limited to indoor scenarios and requires an accurate geometric calibration of the LEDs relative to the camera. This also limits their use to headworn or stationary systems. Under natural illumination the extraction of the light sources is a complicated task and user experience suffers from the intrusiveness of the artificial illumination. We propose to use corneal imaging (CI), the analysis of the corneal reflection of the observed scene under natural illumination, to estimate the pose of the eye. We show how the estimated position can be applied to improve the AR experience in OST-HMDs and enable gaze-based interaction with out-ofreach AR and VR content. OST-HMD calibration determines the spatial relation between the scene camera of the HMD and a first-person view camera that models the user\u2019s perception to correctly align virtual content and the real scene. We introduce Corneal Imaging Calibration (CIC), an automated calibration approach for OST-HMDs. The method does not require user interaction and can detect drift of the HMD. Furthermore, it does not require the detection of the iris contour or the eye pose, a requirement of previous automated methods. This improves the robustness in environments where the iris contour cannot be detected reliably. We present an in-depth evaluation and discuss possible error sources and drift detection strategies. Interaction with out-of-reach AR and VR content, e.g., projectorand OST-HMD-based AR, requires input through external controllers or voice commands. Eye-gaze based interaction offers a more socially acceptable and natural interaction with such content and has been proposed as part of AR application. We propose a new passive gaze tracking approach based on the estimated position of the eye. Our Hybrid eye-pose estimation does not require IR LEDs commonly used in commercial systems and adopts the approach used by these systems for use with images taken under natural illumination. We show, that our method can estimate the user\u2019s iris size and account for the", "year": 2017}

This article proposes a natural human\u2013robot interface using an adaptive tracking method, which can effectively expand the operational space while ensuring high accuracy. The natural interface allows the robot to directly reproduce the user's hand movement, making the interaction more intuitive and natural. The leap motion is fixed on the Cartesian platform to capture the movement of the user's hand. Because the Cartesian platform follows the hand and keeps the hand in the center of the detection area, the measurement accuracy is improved and the measurement space can be extended. During the process of acquiring gesture data, the measurement errors were found to increase over time because of the inherent noise of the sensor. To deal with this problem, the unscented Kalman filter is applied to estimate the position of the hand. Moreover, an adaptive velocity control method is proposed to improve the operation accuracy and reduce the task execution time with the consideration of users\u2019 habits and easiness of usage. The effectiveness of this interface is verified by a series of experiments, and the results show that the proposed interface can be used by nonprofessional users for object operation tasks and can provide users with superior interactive experiences.", "year": 2020}

It can serve to guide the product development process or establish a baseline for customers to make more informed decisions about the products they buy. While software solutions to automate aspects of the LCA process exist, they either have high learning curves stemming from outdated and complex interfaces or suffer from overly simplistic data visualization. The former requires expert knowledge to navigate, while the latter offers no additional direction in the decision making process beyond viewing environmental impacts. As such, there is potential for improvement in these areas to foster wider adoption of LCA software, particularly by product designers and engineers who may have less expertise in environmental assessment. The first half of this paper will focus on technical contributions towards achieving this goal starting with the shared task of designing prototypes and user testing in order to understand our target user\u2019s workflow process. This is followed by details on implementation tasks, which were split into model building and data visualization components. My teammate, Jonya Chen, discusses model building implementation and challenges in her paper, while this paper covers data visualization and back-end implementation. The second half of this paper will then seek to place our LCA application in a broader context by evaluating the ecosystem in which the software would be employed. It will explore potential driving forces for the adoption of such a software, especially by small and medium enterprises. The packaging industry will also be explored as a case study example for positioning of LCA software in a particular industry. Part I: Technical Contributions 1 Motivation for life cycle assessment software improvement Being able to assess the environmental impact of a product promotes sustainable design. One such method to accomplish this is life cycle assessment (LCA) in which a product or service\u2019s \u201cenvironmental burdens... [are] assessed, back to the raw materials and down to waste removal\u201d (Kl\u00f6pffer, 1997, p. 223). As such, LCA aids in the ability to reduce pollution and conserve resources to improve product sustainability (Rebitzer et al., 2014). However, current software aiding in general life cycle assessment are on the extremes of the learning curve and data visualization spectrum. Powerful tools, such as Gabi (Thinkstep, 1991), allow for users to have high control and customization in their analysis but are \u201ccomplicated to use and not user-friendly\u201d (Ren & Su, 2013, p. 48) Whereas simplified tools, such as Sustainable Minds (Sustainable Minds, 2008), allow ease in modeling systems but lack in detailed qualification of the results to improve assessments (Ren & Su, 2013). This can be seen in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. These extremes make it slow and difficult to obtain meaningful interpretation of results for the non-expert. Figure 1. Multi-screened, complex user interface for modeling environmental impacts from GaBi4. Figure 2. Single endpoint impact score decomposed into midpoint scores from Sustainable Minds doesn\u2019t provide users with additional information on certainty/quality of reported scores. In an effort to expand the user base for LCA software beyond the expert LCA practitioner to product designers and engineers, we propose that an improved workflow involving uncertainty analysis will save time in collecting product information, ease the learning curve of running LCA, and provide more informative results. The improved workflow relies on two major components: facilitating model building and displaying uncertainties associated with calculated environmental impacts. User testing was performed for various model building and data visualization design prototypes followed by an implementation phase of concepts and insights gleaned from user testing. 2 Understanding the user through iterative design, prototyping, and user testing One major goal of our project is to increase LCA adoption amongst product designers and engineers. As such, understanding how to better facilitate in the process of conducting LCA was of most importance. The design process consisted of iterations of rapid prototyping and user testing to not only come to an understanding of our target user but to also ensure that the translation of that understanding to a software functionality was accurate. The user testers were selected from a pool of Master\u2019s of Engineering candidates with experience in product design and/or mechanical engineering. It is important to note that this mostly homogenous pool of similarly aged students with limited industry experience may have introduced bias in our user testing. Insights can be further improved by broadening the pool to include individuals with more industry experience or from other engineering disciplines. The prototyping and user testing phase was a joint responsibility that involved brainstorming various prototypes, splitting up and conducting user tests, and discussing results as a preface to the next round of iterations as can be seen in Figure 3. This was done in two phases \u2013 one for prototyping model building and the other for data visualization. Figure 3. Individual responsibilities in the design cycle phase. 2.1 Model building prototypes helped identify user workflow The designs started off as low-fidelity paper prototypes, in which we would simulate the computer response to interactions during user testing. The use of low-fidelity prototyping at the early stages allowed for many rough ideas to be explored due to its fast turnaround (Wong, 1992). Users were given a bill of materials for a fridge as well as information gathered about its transportation, energy consumption, and product end of life (see Appendix A.1) and asked to navigate inputting the information in the multiple prototypes. The initial prototypes, examples of which can be seen in Appendix A.2-5, explored a variety of workflows as well as representations for library and model components. User testing questions explored how to best support intuitive workflow. These included how users would add components to a model as well as how to guide users through the process of conducting life cycle assessment. The major differences tested were: 1) having a constant library of materials/processes or life cycle tabs leading to areas where specific components could be added; 2) associating processes in the same step as selecting a material (one-shot) or after materials are added to the model (one-by-one); and 3) model components in a listed format or as draggable objects on a workspace. From the first user test, there was a general consensus that the tabs provided structure in understanding general steps of running life cycle assessment but users preferred the flexibility of an open library. Users commented that direct association of components in the same step could be complex when the user desires to link many components and would likely require many mouse clicks. Rather, they preferred association via direct manipulation where components could be dragged together to link. Despite this, the list views of the model fared better than the workspace layout due to concerns of display complexity with models consisting of a large number of components. With a general sense of the users\u2019 workflow, the second and third design iterations sought to expand upon the differences between the workspace and list view (Figures 4a-c), to explore various prototypes for streamlining component associations (Figures 5a-b), and to introduce concepts for grouping/creating subassemblies (Figures 6a-b). A major disadvantage of the earlier paper prototypes was that the simulated interactions on paper are not reflective of how a user may actually interact with a system. As Uceta et al. (1998) suggest, PowerPointTM can be an effective means of adding interactivity by hyperlinking screens together to emulate an interaction. The remainder of the prototypes were created and tested with this technique in mind and example screenshots of key concepts can be seen below. Figure 4a. Iteration 2 workspace format with direct manipulation of draggable components and constant library. Figure 4b. Iteration 2 list format of added components with life cycle tabs. Figure 4c.

Going from the second to third iteration, we were able to narrow the general layout in favor of the list view with life cycle tabs but wanted to maintain the direct manipulation seen in the workspace view. Users thought that the clear division of the library into life cycle categories (Figure 4b) was helpful in organizing their model but commented that the tabs lacked visual cues to suggest functionality. This was clarified in the third iteration as can be seen in Figure 4c. For the process of streamlining component associations, users commented that the similarity of the one-shot addition prototype (Figure 5b) to Autodesk panels made the process intuitive and quick to navigate. However, the prototype was also criticized due to having only a small fraction of the screen be the user\u2019s locus of attention as well as overlaying the panel on the model. They mentioned that this was not an issue seen in the workspace prototype where objects could be directly manipulated and dragged around (Figure 4a), as the library supplemented the model rather than forcing the user to focus on a particular part of the screen. Lastly, for grouping, users suggested to maintain co", "year": 2017}

Social media marketing encompasses both firm-generated and user-generated content, effectively fostering consumer connectivity with brands and companies, thereby influencing their preferences for products and services. Consumer engagement serves as a prominent factor, leading consumers to launch meaningful interactive brand-related conversations and experiences, primarily in online settings. This research ascertains the mediating role of consumer engagement in the relationship between social media strategies and the consumer decision-making process for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). A descriptive research design and multi-stage sampling were employed to get the responses from the users of FMCG products in selected states of North India. Baron and Kenny\u2019s Model for mediation analysis in regression has been conducted to test the hypothesis. The results of the study reflected the partial mediation of consumer engagement in the relationship between social media strategies and the consumer decision-making process for FMCG products. This study provides marketers with a novel approach, suggesting that they can foster consumer engagement on social media platforms related to products or brands, enabling consumers to actively influence the decision-making process for FMCG products. This framework offers them an opportunity to expand their customer base, enhance product offerings, and ultimately boost sales of FMCG products by influencing prospective consumer behavior.", "year": 2023}

However, the weak signal power received on Earth from GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) represents a significant threat to their integrity and resilience since they are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and disruption by space weather events. There is therefore considerable motivation to progress beyond GNSS-based time and frequency dissemination techniques. \n\nHowever, any alternative time and frequency distribution technique must have a high degree of resilience with built-in redundancy. Moreover, in order to facilitate widespread and rapid uptake by industrial and commercial users, any alternative should possess a number of features: it should lend itself to standardization and be capable of practical interfacing with existing network infrastructures; it should be scalable and address a range of user requirements; and it should enable measurement traceability to the time standard Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). \n\nOne potential alternative to satellite-based techniques for time and frequency distribution which meets these criteria is the White Rabbit (PTP-WR) protocol. This open-source technology provides sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision of synchronization over optical fibre, scalable to many nodes. The protocol is developed at CERN in collaboration with research organisations and companies, leading to rapid innovation and commercialisation opportunities. It has recently been integrated into the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) standard as IEEE 1588-2019 PTP High Accuracy, a significant achievement which will facilitate industry uptake. \n\nIn June 2018, the White Rabbit for Industrial Timing Enhancement (WRITE) project was started with the aim of further developing the PTP-WR hardware, monitoring and calibration techniques. The project will demonstrate resilient, validated, precision time dissemination to industrial and commercial user testbeds, which will be UTC traceable. As of October 2020, the WRITE project has already made significant progress in improving PTP-WR methods and devices, validating some techniques on in-field deployments. Four testbeds have been established, designed to demonstrate UTC(k) dissemination to industry partners alongside the \u2018accuracy\u2019, \u2018precision\u2019, \u2018redundancy\u2019 and \u2018connectivity\u2019 challenges identified by the project. Outreach activities such as a virtual Stakeholder workshop have facilitated the WRITE project engagement with end users in industry, research, NRENs (National Research and Education Networks) and metrology. \n\nAs part of this project, new scalable calibration techniques have been developed for fibre propagation asymmetry, PTP-WR devices and SFPs. Calibration of each individual component of a PTP-WR link is required for interoperability of PTP-WR equipment from different manufacturers and replacement in the event of equipment failures. A system with calibrated components will in future lead to \u201cplug-and-play\u201d cost-effective time services to industry, replacing expensive in-situ end-to-end calibrations of each link. NPL are participating in this interoperability testing of a new PTP-WR device, using the White Rabbit Electrical Absolute Calibration technique.\n\nThe WRITE project is also investigating network topologies and monitoring techniques to improve redundancy.

These patterns carry inherent meanings, which can be learned from and acted upon, even if the user is not expressly aware of having communicated them. In this sense, these implicit patterns can be thought of as input modalities that, in practice, serve a very similar purpose to the more tangible input modes described above. Mining behavioral patterns through machine learning can help designers to better understand users and serve their needs. At the 32 | Machine Learning for Designers same time, these patterns can also help designers to understand the products or services they offer as well as the implicit relationships between these offerings. Behavioral patterns can be mined in rela\u2010 tion to an individual user or aggregated from the collective behav\u2010 iors of numerous users. One form of pattern mining that can be useful in serving an individ\u2010 ual user as well as improving the overall system is the discovery of frequently coupled behaviors within the sequence of actions per\u2010 formed by the user. For example, a user may purchase milk when\u2010 ever he buys breakfast cereal. Noticing this pattern gives designers the opportunity to construct interface mechanisms that will allow the user to address his shopping needs more easily and efficiently. When the user adds cereal to the shopping cart, a modal interface suggesting the purchase of milk could be presented to him. Alter\u2010 nately, these two items could be shown in proximity to one another within the interface, despite the fact that these two products would generally be situated within two different areas of the store. Rather than presenting the user with separate interfaces for each item, the system could instead dynamically generate a single interface element that would allow the user to purchase these frequently coupled items with one click. In addition to benefiting the user\u2019s shopping experi\u2010 ence and enabling multiuser recommendation engines, the system\u2019s knowledge of these correlated behaviors can be used to make the system itself more efficient, aiding business processes like inventory estimation. Mining user behavior patterns can also help businesses to better understand who their customers are. If a user frequently purchases diapers, for instance, it is a near certainty that the user is a parent. This kind of auxiliary knowledge of the user can help designers to produce interfaces that better address their target customer demo\u2010 graphics and influence business and marketing decisions such as the determination of which advertising venues will yield the greatest influx of new customers. Designers should be careful, however, to not make assumptions about users that may embarrass or offend them by characterizing them in ways that conflict with the public persona they wish to convey. In one famous incident, the retailer Target used purchasing patterns to determine whether a given user was pregnant so that the store Enhancing Design with Machine Learning | 33 8 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html could better target this much sought-after category of customer.8 Though this practice may be welcomed by some, in at least one case it created an uncomfortable situation when an angry father came to a Target store demanding to know why his high-school-aged daugh\u2010 ter had received numerous coupons targeted at expectant mothers. The man had not been aware that his daughter was pregnant and upon learning the truth from his daughter, apologized to the retailer. Nevertheless, these kinds of customer insights can be unsettling and require great care in their treatment by designers. Issues of this kind will be discussed in greater detail in the section \u201cMitigating Faulty Assumptions\u201d on page 52. When handled with care, however, user insights can provide great value to customers and businesses alike. Understanding a user\u2019s behavioral patterns can also aid security processes such as the detec\u2010 tion of fraudulent use of a customer\u2019s account information. Credit card companies and some retailers regularly use consumer purchas\u2010 ing patterns to assess whether a given purchase is fraudulent by checking whether the geographic location of the transaction and the items purchased are in line with the customer\u2019s history. If an anom\u2010 aly is detected, the transaction will be blocked and the customer will be notified that their financial information may be compromised.", "year": 2016}

Such motion is characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions: slight differences in initial conditions lead to very different behaviors at later times. This phenomenon is observed in various physical systems; studying it has benefits for engineering applications. The oscillator itself is an inverted pendulum in the form of a narrow flexible 3D printed strip. One end is fixed in place. The other end is fitted with small permanent magnets situated between a pair of Helmholtz coils. The coils exert a periodically varying force on the magnets, causing the strip to oscillate. Much of the apparatus is 3D printed, including the forms on which the coils are wound. To capture the pendulum\u2019s movement, an infrared Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser range sensor is used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi board that is programmed to analyze the pendulum\u2019s motion and display it graphically on a monitor. The completed project will be available for use by the SUNY New Paltz Physics Department as an educational tool in their Nonlinear Dynamics course. Abstract The purpose of this project is to build an autonomous delivery robot started by a Senior Design Team in Spring 2020 for the SUNY New Paltz campus. The robot would be able to deliver packages such as online purchases, food, or textbooks to students and faculty at the doorstep of their building. This will help modernize SUNY New Paltz to keep up with advancing technologies. The robot came with limited mobility and navigation capabilities, making it not truly autonomous. Improvements to obstacle sensing, drivetrain power delivery, and navigation were made. A website was created to send an email to the delivery recipient with the pin to unlock the cargo storage and give access to the current location of the robot on campus. With these improvements to the previous group\u2019s work the result is a secure, easy to use, and autonomous delivery system for the SUNY New Paltz Campus.

One of the labs, referred to as the \u201cCombined Loading Lab\u201d, is a lab that analyzes the strain along a configuration of three perpendicular orientated pipes. Our project will seek to provide real-time strain characterization at six locations along an aluminum pipe configuration. A program contains an algorithm to determine strain using changes in resistance from the six strain gauges. The ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) onboard the microcontroller is used to determine the resistance of the strain gauge through a Wheatstone bridge configuration.

The design team collaborated to analyze and construct an operational quadcopter by initially creating the schematics and developing the plans for the drone during Senior Design I. Then throughout Senior Design II the drone was modified to be capable of basic flight. In addition to programming and adjusting the drone\u2019s flight capabilities, additional innovations and modifications have been incorporated into the final drone design phase, therefore improving it and allowing more capabilities. One such improvement will be to the flight capabilities, which will be accomplished by using components such as a gyroscope, video capture system, and improved RC telemetry with an FS-X6B receiver. The drone will use four 3D printed propellers powered by four brushless 3-phase AC motors running on a 12V Li-Po battery that is operated remotely using a controller. The drone will be using an STM 32 F405 Matek microcontroller for operation, programmed using C and iNav. The purpose of this project is to improve on current drone designs, think of new drone technology and additions that have not yet been done while keeping the drone cost effective. The drone will also serve as a learning tool by providing an opportunity to work on a project that encapsulates multiple fields of engineering, design and development. Drones fulfill many roles and have important purposes, including photography, surveillance, and research, making this project very versatile. Abstract A 3D printer was designed to print a mixture of two ceramic materials in slurry form with an adjustable material ratio as specified by the user. The main elements of the project consist of a mixing chamber, Abstract This senior design project focused on the steps and series of events to successfully design a programmable charger for the development of new batteries. The goal was to design a closed-loop system that would regulate the desired current allowing the user to program different testing schedules. This will help maximize rechargeable batteries\u2019 efficiency and lifetime. Research included the heat sink to dissipate the heat because of the power absorbed by a transistor from a high current; charging techniques for different batteries; and the Darlington power transistor to deliver high output current to charge the battery. The importance of this project is its long-term effect to give developers a tool to optimize their batteries, benefiting consumers of electronics and energy storage of renewable resources. Abstract The purpose of this project is to have a cooler that can hold items in cold temperature while maintaining said cold temperature. This iteration of the cooler chamber ran on solar power, as well as maintaining voltage, and current input maintenance. It can also be powered by a 12-volt battery that is supplied by the solar panel used in the project. In this project, the Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) was manually constructed by six Peltier\u2019s in the sense of having the highest temperature supply the TEC can supply. Along with measuring the temperature distribution, the voltage and current inputs are monitored using a display module to calculate the amount of power the TEC needs to dissipate the energy inside the cooler chamber. This project cooler design includes the use of MDF particle board as well as the use of a foam insulator to maintain the temperature inside the cold chamber. The principles of heat transfer and thermodynamic fundamentals are used to guide this project\u2019s Abstract Two solar-powered Stirling engines are designed and analyzed: one is an alpha configuration; the other is a beta configuration. The beta configuration is a single cylinder containing a power piston and a displacer piston, and the alpha configuration has two cylinders containing a power piston in each. The heat source is solar radiation. Through convection, the cylinder is heated. The temperature difference, due to the heat source, is the driving force that powers the Stirling engine. Through thermodynamic analysis on the working fluid, compression ratio outputs are analyzed to achieve high efficiency. Through kinematic and kinetic design and analysis of the piston-rod linkages, generated torque and angular velocity are analyzed to achieve desired power outputs. The flywheels of both Stirling engines are connected to a DC generator, using a belt-pulley system, to power an iPhone charger. Abstract Comfortable living conditions are one of the most common desires of any building occupant, be it in a home, business, or hospital. A cost-effective way to maintain a specific room temperature is through the natural ventilation of a window. However, under certain circumstances, windows can be difficult, and even dangerous to open, such as in the case of inaccessible and heavy windows. This project aims to create an electro-mechanical system to automate the process of opening casement windows to mitigate these factors. These windows normally require a crank to open manually and are one of the few most commonly implemented windows to a building. The system implements an electrical circuit which incorporates a thermistor and comparator to regulate the voltage output and power a DC motor. The motor will provide the mechanical torque required to turn a gear-linkage system, which simulates Abstract When a rotating system\u2019s center of mass does not coincide with the axis of rotation the result is an unbalanced system. This can create dangerous situations such as unbalanced car tires and plane propellers. Dynamic balancers are used to prevent this by identifying a system\u2019s unbalance and locating where counterweights should be placed to balance the system. This system will operate between 500-1000 rpm. The apparatus consists of a horizontal shaft long enough for 2 weighted disks, accelerometers mounted near the two bearings to measure acceleration, a tachometer to measure speed, a motor and belt driving the shaft, and a motor controller to control the speed. The accelerometer is connected to the data acquisition unit which feeds into the graphical user interface. This interface will allow the user to input locations of the weights, calculate the acceleration and force caused by any unbalance, and tell the user a location for a counterweight if it is not balanced. The system is firmly mounted to an 80-20 aluminum base and roughly 2 feet by 1 foot. The base sits on rubber shock absorbers to prevent the entire system from moving and to allow for better accelerometer readings. This makes the system safer to use as it will not be able to move across the lab table while experiencing vibrations due to unbalance. There are other safety measures in place such as a shatterproof transparent safety cover with a door on the top to provide access as well as a switch to power off the motor at any time.

In addition, a car manufacturer, if it had a sufficient incentive to develop such a technology, would use it to gain an advantage in the market over rivals. The individual inventor, in contrast, has no incentive to distort the market in favor of one particular firm; his incentive is to license the innovation to all. These arguments suggest that society should be reticent to adopt rules in the patent system that deny patent law\u2019s encouragement to certain safety-enhancing innovations. Important distinctions between web navigation patents and impairment testing should be noted. Web navigation is one of many functions that every business has an incentive to optimize for its customers, whether patents are available or not. Competition will drive firms to adopt such functions. General technologies that improve safety across an entire industry are not necessarily functions that every business has an incentive to develop, a proposition established in the law since Learned Hand\u2019s opinion in The T.J. Hooper.105 Some of the victims of unsafe conditions may not be customers of the industry\u2014and the industry will have little incentive to devote resources to reduce such external losses.106 The costs of developing a safety technology may be high, the benefits may not be appropriable, and competition may not reward such innovations. This suggests at least one principle that should be adopted for conceptualfunctions patents: Conceptual-functions patents related to optimizing consumer-firm interactions should be presumptively ineligible for patents. Every business has an incentive to optimize its interactions with consumers\u2014 to make its websites navigable by mobile devices, to order its messages to and from consumers efficiently,107 to suggest alternative and higher priced goods or 105 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir. 1932) (recognizing that though many boats used radio technology, it had not yet become an industry standard and the court was in no position to demand that the rest of the industry conform). 106 Richard A.

Home Depot, Inc., No. 2:15-cv-01672 (E.D. Tex. filed Oct. 21, 2015). Based on the argument of this paper, this claim should be rejected under Alice. 1142 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 96:1117 services,108 and so on. The patent system should not grant exclusive rights in customer-oriented or supplier-oriented business functions. If the presumption against patentability suggested by Alice is to be extended beyond algorithmic patenting into conceptual-functions patenting, which I have suggested may be desirable, the next set of concepts to bring under Alice are those involving the customer-firm or supplier-firm interface. The doctrinal test of Alice can remain without doing any harm; it is too vague to have much of an impact anyway on its own. If there is any practical rule that Alice should stand for, it is for a presumption against patent eligibility for both algorithmic software applications and for business methods that enable firms to sell, advertise, or interact with consumers more efficiently. This subset of conceptual functions should be left to the process of Schumpeterian competition.109 For conceptual functions with potentially life-saving applications (such as the driver impairment testing claimed by the Roe patent), Alice must tread much more cautiously.110 The reason is that the additional incentive provided by the patent system for life-saving innovations should be considered worth preserving, and the market may be insufficient as a spur to such innovation. On the other hand, these patents have to be assigned boundaries. Although the principle disfavoring abstraction is well entrenched in patent law, it should be modified to constrain patentees more effectively in this area. A doctrine shifting the burden of proof to the patentee to show that his patent really does have boundaries and that there are realistic methods of innovation within the same conceptual function that are not preempted may be appropriate. Alice may have had this effect already. 108 See Tuxis Techs., LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 13-1771, 2014 WL 4382446 (D. Del. Sept. 3, 2014) (invalidating under Alice a patent for \u201cupselling\u201d (i.e., suggesting pricier options) to online consumers). 109 CASS & HYLTON, supra note 8, at 71 (\u201cSchumpeterian creative destruction[] involves the continual introduction of new methods that lead at times to temporary monopolies but are eventually copied by competitors. Patents might provide an additional incentive to develop new methods, but they will also obstruct the process of dissemination and emulation that is core to dynamic competition.\u201d). 110 I should be clear that this suggestion is limited to Alice as a doctrine for invalidating patents. More traditional doctrines for invalidating patents, such as obviousness, do not have to tread cautiously as suggested here. Traditional grounds for invalidating patents have been in operation for many years and should not be affected by Alice. For example, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board granted TRW Automotive US LLC\u2019s petition for inter partes review of a driver-assistance camera patent belonging to Magna Electronics Inc. after TRW demonstrated a reasonable likelihood it would be able to prove the patent was anticipated by previous technology. TRW Auto. US LLC v. Magna Elec. Inc., No. IPR2015-00923, 2015 WL 5818392 (P.T.A.B. Oct. 1, 2015). Although this is an example of a \u201cdriver safety\u201d innovation similar to the Roe patent discussed in the text, the difference is that the PTAB reexamined the patent on obviousness grounds, not on the basis of Alice. 2016] PATENT UNCERTAINTY 1143 My suggestion goes beyond life-saving innovations. Inventions occur along a spectrum from fundamental science, to production-oriented engineering, to methods that serve consumers or end-users efficiently. Fundamental science, such as math and physics, has in large parts been and should be considered ineligible for patents. Innovations that make the firm-consumer or firm-supplier interface more efficient should also be ineligible because the market is a sufficient spur. The production-oriented engineering level is where patents are most effective in enhancing social welfare, and much of this innovation is taking the form of software today. Alice is clearly applicable to this type of innovation. Where there is a danger of granting a property right in the abstract conceptual function, the burden should shift to the patentee to argue that his right will not preempt future innovation within the same conceptual function during the patent\u2019s term. The precise boundary of Alice is unsurprisingly impossible to delineate with precision on the basis of general principles. Software that primarily optimizes the consumer-firm or supplier-firm interaction, or similarly facilitates business processes, should face a presumption of ineligibility under Alice. Potentially life-saving technology generally should not face such a presumption. Software in the online security area seems to fall somewhere in between these two poles.111 Online security software may serve to protect a firm\u2019s data from expropriation from rivals, which is a purely business-centered function that is likely to be spurred sufficiently by market forces without the need for patent protection. Some online security, by contrast, may serve to protect consumers from identity theft, which provides benefits beyond the boundaries of the firm\u2019s own balance sheet. Indeed, given that the primary costs of identity theft fall on the consumer rather than the firm, a profit-oriented firm may have weak incentives to protect the consumer from such theft. The firm may trade off greater convenience in consumer transactions in exchange for less protection of the consumer. Just as in the case of the Lincoln patent, the market may provide inadequate incentives for firms to invest in innovations of this type. However, generally, the degree to which innovation provides important benefits to the public external to the firm\u2019s own income or expenses suggests a fundamental basis for identifying types of innovation that should be approached with great care under Alice. 111 To a degree, the Federal Circuit seems to have edged toward the principles offered here in its DDR opinion, creating an exception to Alice for software \u201cnecessarily rooted in computer technology in order to overcome a problem specifically arising in the realm of computer networks.\u201d DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2014). But this limitation is too general under the theory of this paper and might extend to online security systems that are functionally equivalent to general site security at a factory.

Part of this work concerns the human factors aspects of the control-rooms for the operators of the machine. IFE is applying international standards on human factors (e.g., ISO 11064 [1]) to the design of the main control-room (MCR) and a local control-room (LCR). The work is also intended to satisfy regulatory requirements. So far, for the MCR, we have completed a concept design. User requirements clarification involved interviews with stakeholders and visits to similar facilities. Concept design for the MCR was iterative and involved a user reference-group set up for the project. During several workshops, alternatives for layout and workstations were discussed and modelled using 3D graphics. The chosen concept design and 3D model were then checked against standards. The resulting design was approved by the user-group and now goes forward to detailed design and realization. We have also completed detailed design of the LCR so that it is available for commissioning before the MCR is built. IFE also contributes to the human-machine interface design in other projects, such as for alarm system design and a logbook software application. MAIN CONTROL-ROOM DESIGN PROCESS Phase A: Clarification Step 1 of the adopted ISO process [1] is to clarify operational goals, requirements and constraints associated with the design of the control-room. To achieve this clarification, IFE interviewed several of the main stakeholders in the future control-room, and also interviewed some ESS employees with experiences at similar facilities. IFE also visited the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland and Diamond Light Source in the UK to gather operating experience of similar installations. Interviews for clarification of goals and requirements There was a total of 20 interview sessions covering target control, target cooling, beam physics, beam diagnostics, beam instrumentation, conventional facilities, commissioning, personnel safety (PSS), electrics and I&C, OpenXAL, operations, fire protection, security, control systems infrastructure, cryogenics, alarm design, neutron instruments (NSS) and technical coordination. The intention was to document results so that identified requirements and constraints could be taken into account. Inputs also included several formal documents supplied by interviewees, and design documents. The results of the interviews were organized and presented under several topics: \u2022 General requirements and constraints, \u2022 Safety and security, \u2022 Operation and control, \u2022 Specific human factors and ergonomic issues, \u2022 Work organization, \u2022 Work environment, \u2022 Other restrictions and constraints. Discussion of phase A Phase A resulted in a large amount of interview data and reports from two site visits. All interviews were transcribed from audio files in detail, and as such form a resource for the continuation of the project. The results of these activities are later fed into verification and validation. Phase B: Scenario Analyses for the ControlRoom Step 2 of the adopted ISO process is to analyse and define operational requirements, in this study in particular to understand the tasks delegated to future control-room operators and other significant users of the control centre, across all modes of system operations. This has led to the adoption of a method based on scenario analysis [2][3] and identification of user-types [4][5]. To reach this understanding, IFE, with the help of a reference group, studied selected operating scenarios and types of future user of the control-room. Scenario-Based Design The control-room standard ISO 11064 [1] phase B does not state a specific methodology to carry out the \u201canalysis and definition\u201d phase. A traditional approach for a well-specified system would be to use a Hierarchical Task Analysis [6] methodology. As the present system is still in its infancy, we instead decided to use a combination of: \u2022 \u201cUser-types\u201d, a concept that is based on the idea of \u201cpersonas\u201d and \u2022 \u201cScenario-based design\u201d methodology A user-reference group was created at the beginning of the project involving main stakeholders. A workshop consisting of two half-day sessions was held with the reference group at ESS offices in Lund. Three scenarios were studied: \u201cmachine studies\u201d, \u201cnormal operations with a failure\u201d and \u201cstart-up after a long shutdown.\u201d Within these, the needs of several \u201cuser-types\u201d were characterized: experts, neutron instruments specialists, technicians and engineers, radiation safety officers, and managers. ___________________________________________ \u2020 pierrig.le.darz@ife.no TUPIK060 Proceedings of IPAC2017, Copenhagen, Denmark ISBN 978-3-95450-182-3 1830 Co py rig ht \u00a9 20 17 CC -B Y3. 0 an d by th er es pe ct iv ea ut ho rs 06 Beam Instrumentation, Controls, Feedback and Operational Aspects T22 Reliability, Operability Figure 1: Rendering of the approved MCR concept design: \u201cSnabelA\u201d version 2. Discussion of phase B Results allow recommendations to be made, for example, on the number and placement (work zones) of workstations needed and the main items of equipment to be provided, which together support the main functions and tasks required of the future control-room and its staff. Other issues discussed include large-screen displays, paperwork, procedures, and the working environment. Phase C: Conceptual Design for the Main Control-Room The conceptual design stage comprises the design itself, and the approval of the conceptual design [7]. The purpose of this phase is to develop design concepts that satisfy the required functions, tasks, jobs and organizational plans for the MCR that were established in phase B. The conceptual design aims to include: \u2022 Physical attributes of the control centre \u2022 Furnishings and any special amenities \u2022 The proposed operator interfaces \u2022 Proposed communications tools This phase established the design concepts in context, target specifications and any constraints necessary before proceeding with detailed design. The process aims to result in several design ideas that can be individually appraised and potentially combined, to form an enhanced conceptual design. Method Design concepts were developed using a two-stage workshop process: \u2022 Exploratory workshop \u2013 initial ideas from IFE were presented to the reference group in a workshop format. \u2022 Confirmatory workshop \u2013 the strongest ideas from the first workshop were developed to two candidates. The participation of the reference group of users was essential for the success of these workshops. A \u201cstory\u201d with strengths and weakness for each concept was developed beforehand. Comments and design ideas were noted and incorporated or otherwise resolved after the workshops. At the end of the exploratory workshop, two concepts out of six were selected for further development and presentation to the second workshop. The confirmatory workshop resulted in the unanimous approval by the reference group and IFE. The design is shown in Figure 1. Conceptual verification and validation The final conceptual design was subjected to a verification and validation check. ISO 11064-7 [8] describes how to verify and validate a control-room design. It is mostly concerned with giving a suitable process for V&V, rather than giving details on how V&V is done. We adopted a qualitative approach covering: \u2022 Applicable standards, e.g., ISO 11064 \u2022 Experience from the visit to PSI \u2022 Experience from the visit to DLS \u2022 Results of interviews in phase A \u2022 Results of the analyses of scenarios in phase B Concept design is followed by detail design and realisation of the MCR. The finished MCR will not be available when beam commissioning starts. Therefore, a commissioning control facility needs to be provided. DESIGN OF ESS LOCAL CONTROL-ROOM Space has been allocated for commissioning in the klystron gallery, the \u201clocal control-room\u201d (LCR). The cryogenics plants as well as the test stand will also be operated from here [9].

The design team also used its acquired knowledge from the MCR concept design and the standing reference group. This allowed the first two phases of the ISO process to be grouped in a human factor requirement and constraint phase. IFE developed 6 alternative concept designs, which were discussed in a workshop involving all stakeholders. The workshop was successful in reaching a consensus on a balance of human factors requirements and constraints and user requirements and constraints\u2013Figure 2. The workshop was also used to clarify additional needs specific to the LCR. Figure 2: LCR concept selected by the workshop. The LCR detailed design phase included consideration of control-room siting, control-room arrangement, work station layout and design, sightlines and fields of vision of displays, environmental design, and finally, a verification and validation review of the design based on checklists developed from [8]. The resulting design work (Figure 3) was used to write invitations to tender for supply of LCR equipment. Suppliers have been selected in early 2017, and equipment will be supplied in spring, 2017, in time to allow beam commissioning.

This study investigated the impact of various levels of visual encoding on automation transparency. First, three typical flight modalities were selected as test scenarios, including obstacle avoidance, dynamic tracking, and waypoint flight. Then, each of the three modes were all visually encoded at three levels by introducing more visual channels. A single-factor independent experiment was conducted, in which participants completed the corresponding tasks. The experiment results showed that the level of visual encoding had a significant impact on interface automation transparency. Participants achieved better performance in most of the test tasks as the level of visual encoding rose. However, the upward trend from level 2 to 3 tended to level off. Meanwhile, the cognitive load of the participants showed a slight rebound following a decline. This research also revealed disparities in the efficacy of the several visual channels, with the position being more potent than color, texture, and shape.", "year": 2023}

Medoids are actual objects that are randomly selected as the most centered object in a cluster so that the k-medoids algorithm is robust against outliers. Grouping objects in cluster analysis based on similarities between objects. Measurement of similarity between objects can use the euclidean and manhattan distances. The use of distance in cluster analysis can affect cluster results. Validation of cluster results using internal validation, namely the silhouette index. The Weighted-Length Recency Frequency Monetary (W-LRFM) model is a model that applies the relative importance (weight) of the LRFM model according to the importance of each variable in the LRFM model. LRFM model is a model used for customer segmentation based on customer behavior which consists of variables length, recency, frequency, and monetary. The relative importance (weight) of the W-LFRM model uses the Analytics Hierarchical Process (AHP) method. The W-LRFM model is used to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) of each cluster. The implementation of k-medoids and the W-LFRM model in this study are used for customer segmentation based on the length, recency frequency, and monetary variable. The formation of these variables is the result of transformation of customer behavior data such as transaction id, date of purchase, and a total amount of 41,073 rows into variable length, recency, frequency, and monetary as much as 5,108 rows. The criteria of the best cluster formed are k = 2 using the manhattan distance with the average of coefficient values = 0.62.

Lack of understanding of systems approaches, and the value that they add, make it difficult to elicit input from clients, partners, and even other engineering disciplines. This paper advances techniques for improving engagement through the design of diagrams that cater to stakeholder needs, and that are developed in collaboration with them. By providing a straightforward diagrammatic view of the system information, and making this view available to a wide audience, feedback on the structure and content of the information is typically more forthcoming. With this in place there is less reliance on right-first-time system information, and an iterative development process can be followed. Examples of diagrammatic views are presented, along with explanations of their use in rail projects in both the UK and Australia. These show how engaging stakeholders through simple diagrams can be the start of a pathway into more advanced systems engineering techniques. 1. Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement is a mechanism used by most large organisations to reach understanding and agreement around complex or concerning issues relating to their business. It forms a key part of corporate social responsibility, where stakeholder engagement is often used as a synonym for public engagement; however, depending on the area of an organization's business, the set of stakeholders may be significantly wider than just the general public. For example, in major infrastructure programmes the public will typically be engaged as an end user, alongside operators, maintainers, manufacturers, supply chain organisations, governmental bodies, regulators, design and build contractors, facilities providers, shareholders, and many more. The responsibility for engaging with stakeholders is usually split across the organisation depending on the task at hand, and could fall to one of several internal departments. For an engineering project it may be the task of either project management or systems engineering. From the perspective of systems engineering, it is often beneficial to detail which stakeholders relate to the specific systems of interest. In the systems view, stakeholders can exist within the organisation or delivery programme, such as: engineering disciplines, related projects, safety representatives, and management. Engineering stakeholder management is a large field that is well covered in the general project management literature, for example by the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK) (Project Management Institute 2017). It typically involves activities such as stakeholder identification, analysis, mapping, planning, and management. One aspect that typically comes under the remit of the systems engineer on a project is the definition of stakeholder needs. The Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) recommends a number of approaches for collecting stakeholder needs and requirements, a number of which are diagrammatic, e.g. use case, functional flow or activity diagrams (SEBoK contributors 2017). SEBoK also lists the following as major pitfalls encountered in dealing with stakeholders: the operator role not being considered; exchanges or physical connections with external objects being forgotten, and stakeholders being forgotten. Although the focus within the systems engineering literature is typically on needs and requirements, there is a wealth of other information that should be gathered from stakeholders, particularly in large scale integration programmes where it can be difficult to agree a common understanding of programme aspects such as scheduling, design input, and interface ownership allocation. In this work we are interested in this larger problem of engaging engineering stakeholders, to provide and agree on a specific set of technical or project information. Outside of systems engineering a similar problem is addressed in various fields involved in large scale societal change, such as sustainable farming methods or climate change mitigation, where stakeholder engagement plays a vital role (Sequeira and Warner 2007). Research in this area has proposed a number of models around the concept of a ladder of participation (Arnstein 1969, Hart 1992, Pretty 1995). These typically range from non-participation at the bottom of the scale, through information provision and consultation, up to partnership and, ultimately, stakeholder control at the top. The general message being that increasing participation, through changes in project engagement approach, will lead to improved outcomes overall. This type of model has been criticised however, for failing to capture the dynamic nature of user involvement and users\u2019 individual agency in determining their own level of involvement (Tritter and McCallum 2006). Applying the ladder of participation concept from an engineering perspective these criticisms seem valid, alongside a general concern that most stakeholders would simply not be qualified to take full control (the top of the ladder) in the type of projects we are interested in. Those points notwithstanding, the approach proposed in this paper is aimed at moving stakeholders up the ladder of participation. The need for a cycle of stakeholder consultation is well recognised, with five steps for iterative consultation being proposed as: plan ahead; consult using basic principles of good practice; incorporate feedback; document the process and results of consultation; and report back (Sequeira and Warner 2007). This provides a sound general concept, but does not detail specifics in achieving the steps; here we provide those details in the specific context of systems engineering. In developing any effective stakeholder engagement approach negative psychological and social phenomenon such as the bandwagon effect (increased acceptance of ideas based on their adoption by a number of others), groupthink (poor decision making due to a desire for conformity) and communal reinforcement (increased preference for ideas due to their repeated assertion within a community) should be taken into account. In contrast there are also a number of positive effects that should be maximised such as the wisdom of crowds (the tendency for estimation from a group to be better than from their individual members) and the benefits gained from collaboration and peer review. A number of general purpose approaches to crowdsourcing information have been implemented to attempt to address these issues and magnify the positives. These include techniques such as prediction markets (aggregation of information through the placing of bets) and the Delphi method (iterative facilitated forecasting by a panel of experts to reach consensus predictions). Whilst these may be too complex and resource intensive for most stakeholder engagement issues, some of their key strengths are noted for application to our process, specifically: \uf0b7 Gathering input from a large number of contributors; \uf0b7 Polling of participants individually; \uf0b7 Repeated iterations to drive towards consensus; \uf0b7 Review of results and reasoning in between iterations; \uf0b7 Weighting of responses based on the responders\u2019 confidence and credibility. A number of these are either built-in to the proposed process, others should be considered by the practitioner during its implementation. 2. Diagrams in systems engineering A case can be made that the use of diagrams, or more generally, data visualisations, is an essential systems engineering skill (Welford 2016). The importance of ensuring communication and collaboration in order to manage interfaces between both different disciplines and disparate stakeholders requires an approach that is effective, formal and precise. Alongside unstructured free-form text, structured diagrammatic approaches are frequently used to fulfill this need. In general, these may take the form of: work breakdown structures and Gantt charts in project planning; 2D and 3D design images in computeraided design (CAD); flowcharts and systems models for process control; bar, scatter and pie charts in reporting; dashboards and control panels for human-factors work. Within systems engineering there are many further system views that can be represented graphically, including: requirements traceability; functional/product/system breakdown structures; interface matrices; cause and effect diagrams; and sequence diagrams. Certain techniques and disciplines take this a stage further, centering the whole engineering process around modelling and visual methods. Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an increasingly widely accepted approach to practicing systems engineering; the INCOSE Systems Engineering Vision 2025 positioning paper states: \u2018Model-based Systems Engineering will become the \u201cnorm\u201d for systems engineering execution, with specific focus placed on integrated modelling environments.\u2019 (INCOSE 2014). MBSE is centred around using an information repository, or model, as the single source of truth on a project. The information contained in the model is typically both presented and edited in diagrammatic form. Other disciplines and domains are also pushing to operate in a more digital-centric manner (WSP 2014). Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a process finding increasing use in infrastructure programmes that uses three (or higher) dimensional federated digital physical structure models, sourced from multiple disciplines or parties, as the central design resource. Two dimensional diagrams may then be rendered from the main model for review and production. This bears a close resemblance to the MBSE approach, and the similarities between the two is an area of active investigation (Towers 2017).

Augmented reality glasses are used to construct holograms of the patient's organs from MRI and CT data, subsequently transmitted to the glasses. This, in addition to seeing the actual patient, the surgeon gains visualization inside the patient's body (bones, soft tissues, blood vessels, etc.). The solutions developed at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University allow reducing the invasiveness of the procedure and preserving healthy tissues. This also improves the navigation process, making it easier to estimate the location and size of the tumor to be removed. We describe the application of developed systems to different types of surgical operations (removal of a malignant brain tumor, removal of a cyst of the cervical spine). We consider the specifics of novel navigation systems designed for anesthesia, for endoscopic operations. Furthermore, we discuss the construction of novel visualization systems for ultrasound machines. Our findings indicate that the technologies proposed show potential for telemedicine. Method We have developed software that not only loads and positions the 3D model relative to the marker but also offers an additional user interface for interaction during the surgical procedure. The interface based on gestures and virtual buttons makes it possible for the surgeon to use the extensive range of functions incorporated in the glasses without touching non-sterile objects. We have constructed a system detecting and tracking the observer's position via the HTC Vive positioning system using two trackers, one attached to the glasses, and the other to the calibration pointer. The advantage of this approach compared to existing optical navigation systems is the tracked space of 6 x 6 meters, capturing almost the entire operating room. The system can work with 4 base stations; tracking is possible even if the sensor is within the field of view of only one of the stations. We have developed a versatile headset which will be adjusted to the individual anatomy of each patient. The headset is a flexible frame that is attached to the head at three main points: on the bridge of the nose and in each ear canal. The frame is shaped to provide maximum access to the brain or maxillofacial area during different types of surgeries. The adjustable frame is intended to be attached to the patient's head before the CT scan and re-attached for the surgery in the exact position that it had during the CT scan. For this purpose, the frame is equipped with an adjustment control which can be regulated with a certain step and reset to the same position; additionally, adjustable screws are provided to fix the ear tips in the ear canal. Metal markers are also installed in several points of the frame, which are enhanced with contrast on CT and allow automatically detecting the position of the marker relative to the patient's head. The marker itself, in turn, is removable and does not have to be installed during CT.", "year": 2021}

Youth are a vulnerable population at risk for mental health issues with long wait times to get help [2]. Emotion regulation, the ability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, has been explored as a trans-diagnostic intervention to improve mental health [3]. Youth aged 12-15 use less adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression) that can contribute to depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, training adaptive emotion regulation skills is crucial for this age group [4]. One of the most effective emotion regulation strategies for youth is cognitive reappraisal\u2013changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact [5]. However, learning is difficult because it requires: (1) generation of meaningful emotionally laden social situations; (2) real-time feedback of internal psychological and physiological states; and (3) practice modifying the interpretation of multiple situations [6]. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated 3D environment that allows the user to experience a simulated world through stereoscopic 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. The affordances of VR have been shown to strongly affect human emotional responses and interpretations of social situations when used in other intervention contexts [7]. As such, VR may provide unique opportunities for cognitive reappraisal skills development through three mechanisms: Mechanism #1: virtual environment\u2013a simulated world that evokes the visceral experience of a realistic emotional response; Mechanism #2: interaction & feedback\u2013possibilities to control and modify emotionally evocative aspects of the virtual environment; Mechanism #3: taking multiple perspectives\u2013the ability to put the user in another\u2019s shoes. As an example, you put on a VR headset and find yourself walking down the halls on the first day of high school; there are lots of new faces and you hope to make a good first impression (Mech #1). You hear the sound of your heart beating and your breathing getting heavier and uneven, and other kids laughing\u2013are they laughing at you (Mech #2)? Luckily, you have a super power that allows you to embody other peoples\u2019 perspectives (Mech #3). You take the VR controller, point it at the older kid who was laughing, and teleport into their virtual body (Mech #2). Suddenly, you can see yourself from their perspective and hear their thoughts\u2013\u201clook at all these new kids. I remember my first day I tripped down the stairs and broke a tooth. So embarrassing!\u201d (Mech #3). You teleport back to your body and hear your heart rate drop to indicate that you have regulated the anxiety response (Mech #2). They weren\u2019t laughing at you, but empathizing with your experience. Seeing and understanding this new perspective is cognitively reappraising the event. In this scenario, VR offers youth a way to practice cognitive reappraisal in a safe, meaningful, and emotionally laden environment with real-time feedback; thus meeting the reappraisal requirements (1-3) listed above, which are normally difficult to meet. Objectives & Research Questions: There is a rise in VR\u2019s accessibility and popularity among youth (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 VR headset does not require a computer, costs $400 CAD, and has sold over 5 million units). My expertise in technology development of VR systems and content, design for mental health, and field evaluation skills make me well positioned to take this unique opportunity to investigate the overarching research question: can the above three VR mechanisms (Mechanisms #1-3) address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development in youth aged 12-15? Methodology: I will conduct research that investigates the following research questions that derive from my objectives above: (1) Requirements: What are the minimum technical and design requirements for a VR platform to help youth learn and practice emotion regulation? (2) Usability: What are the system and interface usability factors that youth suggest for the VR prototypes? (3) Feasibility: What is the feasibility of using VR\u2019s three mechanisms to address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development during a six-week deployment with youth in their homes? (4) Efficacy: What are the subjective indicators of effects on cognitive reappraisal skills development (whether positive or negative) reported by youth? I will answer these research questions in three phases.", "year": 2022}

The traditional touch sensing range is 2-D and therefore limits the user experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3-D contactless touch sensing called Airtouch system, which improves user experience by remotely detecting single/multi-finger position. A single layer touch panel with triangle-shaped electrodes is proposed to achieve multitouch detection capability as well as manufacturing cost reduction. Moreover, an oscillator-based-capacitive touch sensing circuit is implemented as the sensing hardware with the bootstrapping technique to eliminate the interchannel coupling effects. To further improve the system accuracy, a grouping algorithm is proposed to group the useful channels\u2019 data and filter out hardware noise impact. Finally, improved algorithms are proposed to eliminate the fringing capacitance effect and achieve accurate finger position estimation. EM simulation proved that the proposed algorithm reduced the maximum systematic error by 11 dB in the horizontal position detection. The proposed system consumes 2.3 mW and is fully compatible with existing mobile device environments. A prototype is built to demonstrate that the system can successfully detect finger movement in a vertical direction up to 6 cm and achieve a horizontal resolution up to 0.6 cm at 1 cm finger-height. As a new interface for human and machine interactions, this system offers great potential in finger movement detection and gesture recognition for small-sized electronics and advanced human interactive games for mobile device.", "year": 2018}

However, staffing and time constraints mean that many EDs are not well equipped to deliver evidence-based interventions for patients experiencing suicidality. An existing intervention initiated in the ED for patients with suicide risk (Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation [ED-SAFE]) has been found to be effective but faces trenchant barriers for widespread adoption. Objective On the basis of the ED-SAFE intervention, we aimed to develop 2 apps for patients with suicide risk: a web app guiding patients through safety planning in the ED (ED app) and a smartphone app providing patients components of the ED-SAFE program on their phones after discharge (patient app). We then tested the usability of these apps with patients presenting to the ED with suicide risk. Methods Using a user-centered design framework, we first developed user personas to explore the needs and characteristics of patients who are at risk for suicide using inputs from clinicians (n=3) and suicidologists (n=4). Next, we validated these personas during interviews with individuals with lived experience of suicidality (n=6) and used them to inform our application designs. We field-tested the apps with ED patients presenting with suicide risk (n=14) in 2 iterative cycles to assess their usability and engagement using a mixed methods approach. We also rated the quality and fidelity of the safety plans created. Results We developed 2 interoperable and complementary apps. The first is a web app designed for use on a tablet device during ED admission that guides the patient by creating a safety plan using a chatbot-style interface. The second is a smartphone app for use after discharge and allows the patient to view, edit, and share their completed safety plan; access self-care education, helplines, and behavioral health referrals; and track follow-up appointments with the study clinician. The initial prototype usability testing (n=9) demonstrated satisfactory scores (ED app System Usability Scale [SUS], mean 78.6/100, SD 24.1; User Engagement Scale, mean 3.74/5, SD 0.72; patient app SUS, mean 81.7/100, SD 20.1). After refining the apps based on participant feedback, the second cycle testing (n=5) showed improvement (ED app SUS, mean 90.5/100, SD 9.9; User Engagement Scale, mean 4.07/5, SD 0.36; patient app SUS, mean 97.0/100, SD 1.9). The quality ratings for completed safety plans were satisfactory (Safety Planning Intervention Scoring Algorithm-Brief, mean 27.4, SD 3.4). Conclusions By adopting a user-centered approach and creating personas to guide development, we were able to create apps for ED patients with suicide risk and obtain satisfactory usability, engagement, and quality scores.

The endpoint for PHR development is often seen as the individual becoming the custodian of their own medical data, with clinicians contributing to the data at each care episode. However, medical data is traditionally maintained by healthcare professionals, with the individual rarely directly contributing. How an individ-ual-controlled PHR might work in the UK context needs investigation? We used a formal method to develop an information architecture, The Open Group\u2019s Architecture Framework (TOGAF). TOGAF helps demystify the process of development and provides reference to common elements expected in contemporary architectures. Without the use of a formal method, users\u2019 needs can remain poorly understood and designs may rest on flawed assumptions. An initial architecture reference model for a PHR was developed based on the literature. This was then used to guide a series of semi-structured interviews with Abstract no. 314 Which Aims Surgical outcomes have traditionally been described using clinician-centred measures such as 30-day mortality, com-plication and reintervention rates. However, there has been a growing recognition that these measures may fail to capture the outcomes that truly matter to patients and, therefore, are poorly equipped to drive improvement in patient-centred care. This study explored the relationship among patient experience measures, patient reported outcome measures and traditional outcome measures on the overall satisfaction of surgical patients with the outcome of their procedure. Methods The patient demographics, operation details and 30-day clinical outcome data of every patient who underwent emergency intra-abdominal surgery at a large teaching hospital over a 4-week period and patients who underwent cholecystec-tomy over an 8-week period were collected. Ethical approval was obtained to administer validated Patient Reported Experience Measures and Patient Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires.

Introduction Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) provides a one-day training course to introduce users to the CPRD real-world primary care database known as \u201cGOLD\u201d. Historically, the course has been delivered face to face or through video conferencing. Demand has grown due to an increase in organisations and individuals who use CPRD data. In March 2015, CPRD replaced this course with a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). The MOOC is available through the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency learning portal, free of charge, to anyone with an interest in CPRD. It was created to build knowledge about CPRD GOLD data and how to use it for health research and enable resources to be re-allocated to other priority work streams. In this study, we set out to evaluate the effectiveness of the CPRD GOLD e-learning course in meeting these objectives. the impacts concluding the analysis in 2016 in order to inform the development of a future Welsh Government demand-led fuel poverty scheme due to succeed Nest from September 2017.

On the other hand, smartwatches and wristbands are wearable sensors able to provide some measures from which to estimate the type and intensity of the physical activity. In that regard, the estimation depends on the average physical activity of the user and is unique (personalised) for each person. Our work consists of a physical activity module that complements the recommender system with the gathered and processed sensor data. It reads the steps data provided by a sensor and returns the type and intensity of the activity performed before a bolus recommendation. Two types of physical activity are being considered (aerobic and nonaerobic) and four levels of intensity. The quantified intensity depends on the average physical activity of the user. Results The system has been implemented using the eXiTCBR tool. The first prototype will be tested in 2017. Discussion Physical activity quantification removes uncertainty involved in the person\u2019s subjective evaluation about that concept. The system requires some initial data. Other consideration to be taken into account, in order to exploit mobile devices, is contextual information.

Objective To demonstrate the application of digital grocery transaction records to measure community food selection with high spatial granularity. food outlets to guide and evaluate product promotions. These data can be harnessed by public health researchers to develop a model for the demand of specific food(s) using store and neighbourhood attributes, providing a rich and detailed picture of the neighbourhood dietary preference. In this study, we generated a spatial profile of food selection from estimated sales in food outlets in Montreal, QC, Canada, using regular carbonated soft drinks (i.e. non-diet soda) as an initial example. Methods From the Nielsen Corporation, we obtained weekly grocery transaction data generated by a sample of 86 grocery stores and 42 pharmacies in Montreal in 2012. Extracted store-specific soda sales were standardised to a single serving size (240 ml) and averaged across 52 weeks, resulting in 128 data points. Using linear regression, natural log-transformed soda sales were modelled as a function of store type (grocery versus pharmacies), chain identification code and socio-demographic attributes of store neighbourhood (e.g. income and education) as measured by the 2011 Canadian Household Survey. The final model selected by cross-validation was applied to all operating chain grocery stores and pharmacies in 2012 (n = 980) recorded in a comprehensive and commonly available business establishment database. The predicted store-specific weekly average soda sales were divided by population denominator and spatially interpolated to provide a geographical representation of unhealthy food preference. Conclusions The current lack of neighbourhood-level dietary surveillance impedes effective public health actions aimed at encouraging healthy food selection, such as development of community health campaign and evaluation of neighbourhood-level response to social and economic policies, including taxation and food subsidiary program. Our method leverages existing grocery transaction data and stores location information to address the gap in population monitoring of nutrition status and urban foodscapes. Future applications of our methodology include demand prediction from other store types (e.g. convenience stores) and food products across multiple time points (e.g. mouths and years). bio-banking, big data Abstract The objective of this poster is to demonstrate the structure and use of DGen, an object-oriented approach to Data GENeration and DeGENeration of clinical data in various formats. The generation of artificial data is a topical subject for clinical research as it offers ways to stress-test systems, test algo rithms in the presence of known data and of course for training and educational purposes. The generation of artificial data is characterised by two competing specifications: data should be generated according to pre-specified rules and data should be realistic. The impact of these two competing specifications is high for educational purposes as, it is desirable to train students over known, simple test-cases but not so simple as to be obvious and \u2018text-book\u2019 examples. A number of tools (and techniques) for the simulation of data in general and clinical data in particular already exist at various levels of complexity in installing, seting up and operating them. DGen attempts to address the problem of generating artificial clinical data, of realistic complexity, by a framework of elementary Data Generators and Pertubators. Generators are responsible for creating random variables with full control over the characteristics of their values, and Pertubators are responsible for applying commonly encountered errors such as punctuation, abbreviation, data omission and others to the generated values. DGen uses operator overloading to define a very simple \u2018algebra\u2019 of combining generators to form complex cases (such as con ditionally probable ones) and generalisation to create more complex entities such as \u2018Patient\u2019, \u2018CasePatient\u2019, \u2018ControlPatient\u2019 and others.

Few studies have examined user experiences or perceived benefits of maternal and infant health app use from consumer perspectives. Objective This study aims to assess users\u2019 self-reported experiences with maternal and infant health apps, perceived benefits, and general feedback by analyzing publicly available user reviews on two popular app stores\u2014Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Methods We conducted a qualitative assessment of publicly available user reviews (N=2422) sampled from 75 maternal and infant health apps designed to provide health education or decision-making support to pregnant women or parents and caregivers of infants. The reviews were coded and analyzed using a general inductive qualitative content analysis approach. Results The three major themes included the following: app functionality, where users discussed app features and functions; technical aspects, where users talked about technology-based aspects of an app; and app content, where users specifically focused on the app content and the information it provides. The six minor themes included the following: patterns of use, where users highlighted the frequency and type of use; social support, where users talked about receiving social support from friends, family and community of other users; app cost, where users talked about the cost of an app within the context of being cost-effective or a potential waste of money; app comparisons, where users compared one app with others available in app stores; assistance in health care, where users specifically highlighted the role of an app in offering clinical assistance; and customer care support, where users specifically talked about their interaction with the app customer care support team. Conclusions Users generally tend to value apps that are of low cost and preferably free, with high-quality content, superior features, enhanced technical aspects, and user-friendly interfaces. Users also find app developer responsiveness to be integral, as it offers them an opportunity to engage in the app development and delivery process.

Management of SSc is not easy, for both patients and physicians [2]. Symptoms are manifold and have a significant impact on patient\u2019s daily autonomy and psychological well-being.SScEntry (SSc data Entry tool; Figure 1) is a solution conceived to assist SSc patients in monitoring their disease, as a kind of \u201csentry\u201d. The core idea is to provide patients with a personal diary to annotate and track the onset, evolution and resolution of symptoms as well as any changes in their general health condition, through an app for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets.Figure 1.SScEntry logo.SScEntry is a smartphone/tablet app designed by rheumatology and computer science engineering specialists in close partnership [3]. A carefully designed user interface (UI), inspired to a social network wall, allows annotating the evolution of symptoms by means of standard clinical investigation methods such as scientifically validated questionnaires. The UI facilitates data collection through speech-based interaction as well as touch and gestures optimized for patients with finger skin lesions and joints impairments. User engagement over the course of time is fostered by: follow-up reminders to update information on the evolution of past events and periodic questionnaires for general health assessment; the integration of symptom photos taken with on-device camera and health data collected from wearable devices; gamification features. Privacy and security have been a primary design concern, with app access protection and full on-device data encryption; no personal data transmission occurs without explicit user consent. SScEntry generates a disease activity summary report, for displaying to the physician during visit or emailing/printing.SScEntry is ready for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. All planned features have been implemented (Figure 2). Currently supported languages are English and Italian. Areas of interest include vascular, cutaneous, articular, visceral (gastro-intestinal and cardio-pulmonary) as well as relationship, sexual and working life.Figure 2.SScEntry features.Novel Narrative-based Medicine approaches are getting increasing attention to enhance the mutual understanding between patient and physician, reinforcing the therapeutic adherence at the core of healthcare. This is particularly important with chronic and disabling diseases like SSc. Involving patients in disease management with SScEntry will increase their compliance and confidence, with benefits on psychological well-being. Expected benefits for rheumatologists include better evaluation of target therapy and outcomes, as no data on disease activity is lost during the patient clinical history.[1]J. Varga et al.

However, most existing VR headsets only rely on traditional joysticks or camera-based user gestures for input control and human tracking, missing an important source of information, namely, brain activity. Hence there is a growing interest in incorporating brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) into VR/MR systems for consumer and clinical applications [1]. As illustrated in Fig. 33.2.1, an existing VR/MR system integrated with EEG channels typically consists of a VR headset, a 16/32-channel EEG cap, a neural recording analog frontend, and a PC for signal classification. Major drawbacks of such systems include: (1) cumbersome wear and poor user appearance, (2) lack of in situ computing support for low-latency operation, (3) inability for real-time mind imagery control and feedback based on brain activity, (4) high power consumption due to AI classification. To overcome these challenges, this work introduces a mind imagery device integrated into existing VR headsets without extra wearing burden for mind-controlled BMI for a VR/MR system. The contributions of this work include: (1) an SoC supporting in situ mind imagery control for VR/MR systems, (2) seamless integration with existing VR headset and optimized selection of EEG channels to enhance user acceptance and experience, (3) a general-purpose instruction set architecture (ISA) with flexible dataflow, supporting a broad range of mind imagery operations, (4) a confusion-matrix-guided teacher-student CNN scheme to save power during AI operations, (5) sparsity enhancement on EEG signals to reduce energy. A 65nm SoC test chip is fabricated with in situ demonstrations on various mind imagery-based VR controls. While prior works address EEG-based seizure detection or similar biomedical applications [2] \u2013[6], this work focuses on emerging BMI in a VR/MR environment. The digital core of the SoC achieves an energy consumption <1\u03bcJ/class for compute-intensive CNN operations thanks to the low-power features and system-level optimizations of the design.", "year": 2024}

Unfortunately, efficient and effective review of these data is impeded by the varied format, location, and workflow of data acquisition, storage, and processing in the electronic health record. While machine learning (ML) and clinical decision support tools are well-positioned as potential solutions, the translation of such frameworks requires that barriers to implementation be addressed in the formative research stages. Objective We aimed to use a structured user-centered design approach (double-diamond design framework) to (1) qualitatively explore clinicians\u2019 experience with the current asthma management system, (2) identify user requirements to improve algorithm explainability and Asthma Guidance and Prediction System prototype, and (3) identify potential barriers to ML-based clinical decision support system use. Methods At the \u201cdiscovery\u201d phase, we first shadowed to understand the practice context. Then, semistructured interviews were conducted digitally with 14 clinicians who encountered pediatric asthma patients at 2 outpatient facilities. Participants were asked about their current difficulties in gathering information for patients with pediatric asthma, their expectations of ideal workflows and tools, and suggestions on user-centered interfaces and features. At the \u201cdefine\u201d phase, a synthesis analysis was conducted to converge key results from interviewees\u2019 insights into themes, eventually forming critical \u201chow might we\u201d research questions to guide model development and implementation. Results We identified user requirements and potential barriers associated with three overarching themes: (1) usability and workflow aspects of the ML system, (2) user expectations and algorithm explainability, and (3) barriers to implementation in context. Even though the responsibilities and workflows vary among different roles, the core asthma-related information and functions they requested were highly cohesive, which allows for a shared information view of the tool. Clinicians hope to perceive the usability of the model with the ability to note patients\u2019 high risks and take proactive actions to manage asthma efficiently and effectively. For optimal ML algorithm explainability, requirements included documentation to support the validity of algorithm development and output logic, and a request for increased transparency to build trust and validate how the algorithm arrived at the decision. Acceptability, adoption, and sustainability of the asthma management tool are implementation outcomes that are reliant on the proper design and training as suggested by participants. Conclusions As part of our comprehensive informatics-based process centered on clinical usability, we approach the problem using a theoretical framework grounded in user experience research leveraging semistructured interviews. Our focus on meeting the needs of the practice with ML technology is emphasized by a user-centered approach to clinician engagement through upstream technology design.", "year": 2023}

Patient portals linked to electronic health records are recognized as a promising multifaceted tool to help achieve patient engagement goals. Achieving significant growth in adoption and use requires agile evaluation methods to complement periodic formal research efforts. Objective This paper describes one of the implementation strategies that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has used to foster the adoption and sustained use of its patient portal, My HealtheVet, over the last decade: an ongoing focus on user-centered design (UCD). This strategy entails understanding the users and their tasks and goals and optimizing portal design and functionality accordingly. Using a case study approach, we present a comparison of early user demographics and preferences with more recent data and several examples to illustrate how a UCD can serve as an effective implementation strategy for a patient portal within a large integrated health care system. Methods VA has employed a customer experience analytics (CXA) survey on its patient portal since 2007 to enable ongoing direct user feedback. In a continuous cycle, a random sample of site visitors is invited to participate in the Web-based survey. CXA model questions are used to track and trend satisfaction, while custom questions collect data about users\u2019 characteristics, needs, and preferences. In this case study, we performed analyses of descriptive statistics comparing user characteristics and preferences from FY2008 (wherein \u201cFY\u201d means \u201cfiscal year\u201d) to FY2017 and user trends regarding satisfaction with and utilization of specific portal functions over the last decade, as well as qualitative content analysis of user\u2019s open-ended survey comments. Results User feedback has guided the development of enhancements to core components of the My HealtheVet portal including available features, content, interface design, prospective functional design, and related policies. Ten-year data regarding user characteristics and portal utilization demonstrate trends toward greater patient engagement and satisfaction. Administration of a continuous voluntary Web-based survey is an efficient and effective way to capture veterans\u2019 voices about who they are, how they use the patient portal, needed system improvements, and desired additional services. Conclusions Leveraging \u201cvoice-of-the-customer\u201d techniques as part of patient portal implementation can ensure that such systems meet users\u2019 needs in ways that are agile and most effective.

The design is a consequence of an iterative process that had started from researching the main causes for food waste in private kitchens, proceeded with the user involvement and ended with a technological solution. The graduation process that led to the creation was run by Giulia Carletto, with the supervision of David Keyson and Sacha Silvester and at Invivo, design agency in Berlin. The communication, over the distance, between the student and the supervisors was anyway smooth and clear. A summary of the process will follow. The research phase gave precise and stable insights, statistics data were analyzed in order to give a first direction. Since the goal of the project was to help the user change or reduce the habit of throwing away food, the customer journey was used to deeply understand where the difficult tasks for the user lay. Current products were observed so that the different approaches could be analyzed and new possibilities discovered. Interviews were used to understand the reasons behind the unsustainable behaviors. The results were afterwards grouped into three main categories: storing, portioning and FF2. A reflection on these categories followed and a decision was made, to proceed with FF2. This category is represented by those foods that are purchased, partially used and stored in the fridge for their remaining part. FF2 are often wasted because they are forgotten, undervalued or considered spoiled before they actually are. Different behavioral reasons explain this habits and the following task was to find a solution that would tackle all of them. The idea generation phase started and different methods were user: user observation, brainstorming, analogies, workshops and interviews. Every tool gave meaningful insights that helped the student to proceed with a clear goal in mind. One direction was initially chosen: teach the user how to flexibly use those FF2 in order to stop wasting them. The draft of a smartphone app was outlined, paired by a physical product that would help the user combine the needed activities. The informative solution was soon found to be out of track for the designer skills and lacking of feasibility in a short time development.It is believed that this step was also very valuable to the designing process and that it actually led the designer to proceed with the right path. In fact the physical product that was initially matched with the app, was chosen as a final design. This product is Fribo. Fribo is a product-system composed by three physical parts and one smartphone app. Its potential lays in the technology, recently developed, that would allow this sensor to keep track of the spoiling process of food. Fribo is the fridge box, the case for the sensor, the app interface and the device that keeps all the actors communicating together. Its functionalities allow the user to get a notification whenever any of the food that he/she stored in the box, is getting bad. In this way the consumer will not forget, undervalue of wrongly estimate the spoiling process of his/her food. During the last phase of the project, many experts were consulted, especially the creator of the technology which Fribo is based on. This steps were fundamental in order to estimate the feasibility of the system and develop its features at its best. The user involvement was also a method that contributed to create a product that can possibly improve consumers lives and contribute to the reduction of pollution that currently affects the planet. The technology is based in the use of an RFID tag that contains carbon nanotubes, chemically modified to answer to the presence of the gases that are produced by food during the spoiling process. Every food category can produce a different gas, In this way the tag communicates with the reader and send the information concerning which food category started the spooling process. The reader sits inside what is called the Router plug. In fact a smart plug containing crafted PCBs is able to detect the tag\u2019s information, translate them and communicate to the user what it has been detected. The user, at the desired time, will daily receive a notification from Fribo that will involve him/her and inform about the status of the food contained in the box. Fribo is designed so that its maintenance and recycling process would not produce undesired waste. Fribo points at being spread in many households and help consumers reduce their unsustainable behavior. If the advantages that Fribo would produce are calculated, the situation can be improved dramatically. The positive results that would affect the environment relate to water consumption, hectares saved from intensive cultivation, CO2 spread in the air and decrease of deforested surface.", "year": 2016}

There are numerous buying decisions to make each shopping session, there are large ranges of product types to choose from and there is varied arithmetical complexity. The purpose of this paper is to examine how such characteristics influence the attitude of consumers toward online grocery shopping websites.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors hypothesized that the product type (search or experience product), the task arithmetic complexity, and the attention and cognitive load associated with browsing through product pictures have an effect on the attitude of online shoppers toward these websites. To test the hypotheses, 31 subjects participated in a within-subject laboratory experiment.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results suggest that visual attention to product pictures has a positive effect on the attitude of online shoppers toward a website when they are shopping for experience goods, but that it has a negative effect on their attitude toward a website when the task arithmetic complexity is greater. They also suggest that the cognitive load associated with browsing through product pictures has a negative effect on the attitude of online shoppers toward a website when they are shopping for experience goods, and that greater cognitive load variation has a positive effect on their attitude toward a website when arithmetic task complexity is greater.\n\n\nPractical implications\nWhen designing online grocery websites, providing clear single unit quantities with pictures corresponding to the sales unit could help establish a clear baseline on which consumers can work out their quantity requirements. For decisions involving experience goods, product pictures may act as an important complementary information source and may even be more diagnostic than text description.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nResults reinforce the relevance of enriching the study of self-reported measures of the user experience on e-commerce sites with automatic measures.\n", "year": 2019}

However, ANNs are often underutilized in applications where symbolic encoding (SE) of conceptual information is preferred (robotics, games, theorem proving, etc.) since ANN models often employ distributed encoding (DE). The Working Memory Toolkit (WMtk) was developed to aid the integration of an ANN-based cognitive neuroscience model of working memory into symbolic systems by mitigating the details of ANN design and providing a simple DE interface. However, DE/SE conversion is still managed by the user and tuned specifically to each learning task. Here we utilize Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) to overcome this limitation where HRRs provide a framework for manipulating concepts using a hybrid DE/SE formalism that is compatible with ANNs. We validate the performance of the new Holographic Working Memory Toolkit (HWMtk) using two simple partially observable reinforcement learning problems, and show how the HWMtk automates the process of DE/SE conversion for the user while seamlessly providing additional cognitive capabilities such as context switching, cross-task generalization and concept chunking. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is synergistic with a wide range of disciplines but artificial neural networks (ANNs) is perhaps the most prolific subfield. Not only are biological principles of neural computation and neuroanatomy adapted to solve engineering problems, but ANNs also serve as formal, testable hypotheses of brain function and learning in the cognitive sciences. Still, since ANN models often employ distributed encoding (DE), most have limited application in other areas of AI where symbolic encoding (SE) is the norm (e.g. planning, reasoning, robotics). There is extensive evidence that the brain contains a working memory (WM) system that actively maintains a small amount of task-essential information and supports learning in myriad ways: focusing attention on the most taskrelevant features, transfering learning across tasks, limiting the search space for perceptual systems, providing a means to avoid the out-of-sight/out-of-mind problem, and providing robust behavior in the face of irrelevant events (Baddeley 1986; Waugh and Norman 1965). The prefrontal cortex and mesolimbic dopamine system have been implicated as the functional components of WM in humans and animals, and biologically-based ANNs for WM have been developed based on electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological studies (O\u2019Reilly et al. 2002; Kriete et al. 2013). A software library, the working memory toolkit (WMtk), was developed to aid the integration of ANN-based WM into robotic systems by mitigating the details of ANN design and providing a simple DE interface (Phillips and Noelle 2005). The WMtk has been tested in several task domains in the area of cognitive robotics (Tugcu et al. 2007; Erdemir et al. 2008; Busch et al. 2007; Gordon, Kawamura, and Wilkes 2010). Despite the fact that the WMtk can solve common tests of working memory performance, the DE/SE distinction is still problematic for the WMtk. DE/SE conversion still needs to be programmed directly by the user and tuned specifically to each learning task. A technique called holographic reduced representation (HRR) may provide the technical assistance needed to overcome this limitation (Plate 1995). HRRs provide a framework for creating and combining symbolic concepts using a distributed formalism that is compatible with ANNs. Our aim is to create a software engine for encoding and manipulating concept representations using HRRs and integrate it into the WMtk. The newly integrated HRR Engine (HRRE) would greatly simplify the user interface by automating DE/SE conversion. We assess the performance of the new Holographic Working Memory Toolkit (HWMtk) on two main criteria: 1) significant improvement in the ease of use of the toolkit with automated DE/SE conversion, and 2) robust performance on working memory tasks while using HRRs in place of user-defined distributed representations.", "year": 2017}

Breakthroughs made in artificial intelligence, natural language processing and related fields make it possible to replace human labors with online artificial intelligent robots to provide the e-commerce customer service, which indicates the online robots are the future of e-commerce customer services. However, most of the current robots are designed to reply with knowledge matching the key words in question sentences from the database, rarely involving in research on customer intentions that are key factors influencing user experience and online sales. In this research, an intention recognizing model was proposed to obtain intentions of e-commerce consumers by computing the strengths of candidate intention nodes in the intention graph, which was used to describe relations between different goods that could be the intentional targets of e-commerce consumers. The proposed robot was constructed based on the intention recognizing model to identify intentions of consumers and use the located knowledge combined with the AIML based sentence composition template to produce the response sentences for consumers.

Human skeleton-based identification and posture recognition is fulfilled with Kinect depth sensor, from which users can enter different positions according to their preferences for system to learn, ultimately allow appliances have accurate predictive features. Instead of using any third-party media to complete the home appliances control, our system applies face recognition and bone matching technology to open the door, or alarm stranger invasion. Together with child fall/rain protection window, home electric power detection and web controller, it can enhance the intelligent level and security capability of the current smart home system. Introduction With the development of internet technology and mobile internet terminal platform, technologies such as Internet of Things (IOT) are gradually mature, that leads smart home to step into people's lives. In order to improve the intelligent and security level and achieve autonomous control, we designs a smart home [1] automation system based on WiFi data transmission IOT technology and kernel controller STM32. The introduction of Kinect somatosensory device, obtains the human skeleton information which adopts a new identification method [2], and achieves a high recognition rate. The system has the following benefits: low cost, big profit, high practical marketing value. Composition and Design Block Diagram This smart home cloud system mainly consists three parts: the control terminal, the communication link, and the smart user port [3]. The control terminal mainly takes the STM32 as the processing center which collects, analyzes, processes data according to different pre-set conditions. It sends out control instruction signal, and uploads the processing result to the user port through the link, and then provide real-time feedbacks through the APP to the user. WiFi module and cloud server platform for remote data exchange is used in communication link, so that the control terminal and the client can achieve real-time human-computer interaction; the client is used to receive and display system data sent by the control terminal, intuitively shows the status of the home system with a graphical interface, and enable the user to remotely control the home through the interactive interface. The overall system diagram is shown in Figure 1.1, while the system in the family application is shown in Figure1.2.

To date, little is known about how e-retailers can scientifically detect users' intents within a purchase conversion funnel during their ongoing sessions and strategically optimize real-time marketing tactics corresponding to dynamic intent states. This study mainly aims to detect a real-time state of the conversion funnel based on graph theory, which refers to a five-class classification problem in the overt real-time choice decisions (RTCDs)\u2014click, tag-to-wishlist, add-to-cart, remove-from-cart and purchase\u2014during an ongoing session.Design/methodology/approachThe authors propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to detect different states of the conversion funnel by identifying a user's unobserved mindset revealed from their navigation process graph, namely clickstream graph. First, the raw clickstream data are identified into individual sessions based on a 30-min time-out heuristic approach. Then, the authors convert each session into a sequence of temporal item-level clickstream graphs and conduct a temporal graph feature engineering according to the basic, single-, dyadic- and triadic-node and global characteristics. Furthermore, the synthetic minority oversampling technique is adopted to address with the problem of classifying imbalanced data. Finally, the authors train and test the proposed approach with several popular artificial intelligence algorithms.FindingsThe graph-theoretic approach validates that users' latent intent states within the conversion funnel can be interpreted as time-varying natures of their online graph footprints. In particular, the experimental results indicate that the graph-theoretic feature-oriented models achieve a substantial improvement of over 27% in line with the macro-average and micro-average area under the precision-recall curve, as compared to the conventional ones. In addition, the top five informative graph features for RTCDs are found to be Transitivity, Edge, Node, Degree and Reciprocity. In view of interpretability, the basic, single-, dyadic- and triadic-node and global characteristics of clickstream graphs have their specific advantages.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that the temporal graph-theoretic approach can form an efficient and powerful AI-based real-time intent detecting decision-support system. Different levels of graph features have their specific interpretability on RTCDs from the perspectives of consumer behavior and psychology, which provides a theoretical basis for the design of computer information systems and the optimization of the ongoing session intervention or recommendation in e-commerce.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to apply clickstream graphs and real-time decision choices in conversion prediction and detection. Most studies have only meditated on a binary classification problem, while this study applies a graph-theoretic approach in a five-class classification problem. In addition, this study constructs temporal item-level graphs to represent the original structure of clickstream session data based on graph theory. The time-varying characteristics of the proposed approach enhance the performance of purchase conversion detection during an ongoing session.", "year": 2022}

Unfortunately, the interface devices for these games often fail to maintain user engagement for sustained periods of time. By increasing the users' sense of presence within the virtual environment through careful interface design, we hypothesise that user engagement can be maintained. This results in continued use and positive health related gains. In this paper, firstly we introduce an interface for providing users with a natural, cost effective means of locomotion in a virtual environment. This interface is based on a modified elliptical walker (that can connect to any game) and facilitates natural locomotion by mapping the player's movement on the elliptical walker to their character in the virtual environment. We hypothesise that accurately reproducing a natural means of navigation through virtual environments will result in an increased presence compared with a traditional keyboard mouse interface and present our experimental results to support this hypothesis. Secondly, we discuss an application of the proposed interface to mental health - a virtual charity run named `Digital Miles' that was hosted and streamed online by the authors to raise money for an Australian mental health organisation. This application shows the potential of the interface to achieve people's fitness and well-being goals through game-play and raise mental health awareness among a wider audience.", "year": 2016}

The development and application of micro video teaching resources, has been the hot topic in education technology. Based on micro video English teaching resources is difficult to the present situation of the management and application, the design resource management platform, to provide solution for system development, further promote the micro video teaching resources application in English teaching. Technology Framework Design Struts 2 is the Struts of the next generation products, are in the Struts 2 and WebWork technology based on the new framework of the merger. Struts 2 WebWork as the core, using interceptor mechanism to deal with the user's request, make business logic controller and ServletAPI completely away from [2, 3]. Struts 2 is to provide a large number of interceptors, based on plug-in framework, multiple view support, more modular, and Spring integration, based on the advantages of pojo is easy to test, so more and more widely used. It is because of the powerful features of the struts 2 and advantages, in software development for a wide range of applications. The Struts2 framework can be roughly divided into three parts: core controller FilterDispatcher users, business controller Action, and implement business logic components. Among them, the core controller FilterDispatcher is the basis of the Struts 2 framework, includes a framework of internal 3rd International Conference on Management, Education Technology and Sports Science (METSS 2016) \u00a9 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 546 control process and the processing mechanism. Business controller Action and the business logic component need the user to their implementation. Users in the development of the Action and the business logic components at the same time, also need to write the relevant configuration files, for core controller FilterDispatcher to use; Business controller Action is write your own implementation by the developer, the Action class can be a simple Java classes, and the separation from the Servlet API. Action usually have an execute () method, which can also define other business control method; Business model components can be implement the business logic module, can be the EJB, POJO or JavaBean, in actual development, to the distinction between the business model components and definitions are vague, is beyond the scope of the Struts 2 framework. Different developers or teams, have their own way to implement the business logic module, the purpose of the Struts 2 framework is to use Action to invoke the business logic module. The Struts2 framework, the structure is shown in Fig. 1.

These traits position ECAs as innovative tools for delivering interventions for promoting health-related behavior adoption. This includes motivational interviewing (MI), a therapeutic approach that combines brief interventions with motivational techniques to encourage the adoption of healthier behaviors. Objective This study aims to identify the health issues addressed by ECAs delivering MI interventions, explore the key characteristics of these ECAs (eg, appearance, dialogue mechanism, emotional model), analyze the implementation of MI principles and techniques within ECAs, and examine the evaluation methods and primary outcomes of studies that use ECAs providing MI interventions. Methods We conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) methodology. Our systematic search covered the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital, and PsycINFO databases for papers published between January 2008 and December 2022. We included papers describing ECAs developed for delivering MI interventions targeting health-related behaviors and excluded articles that did not describe ECAs with human appearances and without the necessary evaluation or MI explanation. In a multistage process, 3 independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction, and the collected data were synthesized using a narrative approach. Results The initial search identified 404 articles, of which 3.5% (n=14) were included in the review. ECAs primarily focused on reducing alcohol use (n=5, 36%), took on female representations (n=9, 64%), and gave limited consideration to user ethnicity (n=9, 64%). Most of them used rules-driven dialogue mechanisms (n=13, 93%), include emotional behavior to convey empathy (n=8, 57%) but without an automatic recognition of user emotions (n=12, 86%). Regarding MI implementation, of 14 studies, 3 (21%) covered all MI principles, 4 (29%) included all processes, and none covered all techniques. Most studies (8/14, 57%) conducted acceptability, usability, and user experience assessments, whereas a smaller proportion (4/14, 29%) used randomized controlled trials to evaluate behavior changes. Overall, the studies reported positive results regarding acceptability, usability, and user experience and showed promising outcomes in changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Conclusions This study revealed significant advancements in the use of ECAs for delivering MI interventions aimed at promoting healthier behaviors over the past 15 years. However, this review emphasizes the need for a more in-depth exploration of ECA characteristics. In addition, there is a need for the enhanced integration of MI principles, processes, and techniques into ECAs. Although acceptability and usability have received considerable attention, there is a compelling argument for placing a stronger emphasis on assessing changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Consequently, inclusion of more randomized controlled trials is essential for comprehensive intervention evaluations.", "year": 2023}

In this study, we propose an experimental method for designing e-commerce user interfaces with varying levels of aesthetics and usability while maintaining a similar level of user experience. The method is based on the Deming Cycle and Nielsen\u2019s framework for design principles. Four e-commerce websites were designed with low/high levels of aesthetics and usability. Based on 160 surveys, the experimental results demonstrated that it is possible to design user interfaces with varying levels of aesthetics and usability while maintaining a similar level of user design perception. Our findings suggest that usability is more crucial than aesthetics in enhancing user experience, which aligns with previous studies. We also emphasize considering aesthetics and usability in UI design and propose the principle \u201cWhat You Design Is What You Get\u201d (WYDISWYG) as a foundation for future research. Among the evaluated websites, Website1 (the best design) achieved the highest UI quality, with users perceiving it positively at an impressive rate of almost 0.91 percent. In contrast, Website4 (the worst design) had the lowest UI quality, receiving a perception score of only 0.38 percent. The websites designed with a combination of aesthetics and usability, Website2 and Website3, garnered different perception values of 0.79 and 0.51, respectively. While this study has some limitations, such as the subjective selection of features and the focus on e-commerce websites only, it provides a starting point for further investigation into the selection of design principles, consideration of other website domains, and clarification of users\u2019 perception of UI elements to align with Nielsen\u2019s principles.", "year": 2023}

Worth mentioning is the use of 3D printers by defense giants such to manufacture tools and components used for building F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. With the widely observed use of Additive Manufacturing technologies for agile product development in industries, there exists a vital need on innovating, identifying and establishing innovative ways to train emerging manufacturing engineering workforce. This paper, investigates the use of a virtual Rapid Prototyping (RP) simulator developed at The University of Texas at El Paso especially for training and preparing students to meet the needs of industry and for promoting advanced manufacturing technologies in higher education. Considering the increase in computer aided education in this industrial era, RP simulator tool developed provides interested users with a hands on training with an immersive virtual experience to better understanding AM at no significant cost. The developed Rapid Prototyping (RP) simulator tool provided a platform that aided in a hybrid instructional approach for providing both hands-on and virtual learning. The authors in this paper, explore if a non-traditional instruction approach like the RP simulator could compete with and/or substitute to the traditional method (i.e., a face-to-face class). Background With commercial and technological advances of 3-D printing in the current manufacturing continuum, many industries and disciplines are looking to effectively integrate additive manufacturing. A given 3-D printing technology usually unfolds with a computer-aided model to design a product, manufacturing it layer by layer using material such as plastics, metals and in some cases human tissues. Usually, after the design freeze of a product, industries aim for mass production to rapidly introduce it to the market with a slash in time for production. It is projected that the global 3-D printing industry value will rapidly grow from a current $4.5 Billion in 2014 to $17.2 Billion in 2020. 3-D Printing, a technology that makes manufacturing agile along with significantly reducing the waste co-products, is being widely adapted by Pentagon and associated defense industries for several applications along with making sophisticated military equipment. In June 2014, Aerojet Rocket dyne successfully tested an engine built entirely using 3-D printing technology. Over the past 2 years, U.S. Department of Defense has spent more than $2 million on 3-D printers, with their uses ranging from research in the field of medical health to weapons development. Also, it is to be noted that the Obama administration has launched a $30 million pilot program that includes research on using 3-D printing for building weapon parts. Considering this widely-adopted technology trend, there is a significant need to address the technical skills of the emerging workforce and improve their quality of training especially in the field of additive manufacturing. As 21 century industries transition to globally interconnected conglomerates (Industry 4.0), the training programs also need to evolve to provide the high-tech skills required. This portrays a need for innovative focused advanced engineering training techniques that can increase the pool of highly skilled American workers with required proficiency. However, the main implication of teaching emerging technologies in academia pertains to not many institutions (both schools and colleges) continually being able to afford and procure the required technology infrastructure. Accessibility boundaries and constraints limit a given students exposure to emerging technology though available at several major institutions. Authors of this paper towards exploring innovative pedagogical methods in keeping students interested along with an aim of providing unrestricted 24x7 access to technology training, provide an overview of a tutorial on 3D printing technology developed based on Uprint SE plus 3D printer. This tutorial was developed with a main goal of providing access to students 24x7 for understanding and learning the operation of the said 3D printer without any incurred cost, harm, or even training personnel hours. Developed as a successor to legacy Virtual Cyber-Based Rapid Manufacturing tutorial based on (FDM) 3000 machine, this tutorial is a result of the efforts an attempt at Industrial, Manufacturing and Systems Engineering (IMSE) Department of The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). The authors foresee to integrate this tutorial to the current Industrial and Manufacturing courses both at an undergraduate and a graduate level at UTEP. Overview of Uprint SE plus based Rapid Prototyping simulator development To provide a brief background, uPrint SE plus 3D printer is manufactured by Stratasys Inc. It is an FDM technology based machine that is highly integrated where all its tasks are a set of pre-coded modules which are automatically performed. The operation of this printer is based on a simple interface provided that helps the users to navigate and operate the machine easily. Illustrated in figure 1 is uPrint SE plus 3D printer. Figure 1. uPrint SE Plus 3D Printer manufactured by Stratasys To replicate the exact functionality of the printer\u2019s real time operation and its response to the given commands in the virtual simulator, a touch interface was developed for the user to see exactly how the printer reacts to the commands given by mimicking every function of the control panel related to uPrint SE plus-3D printer. To set a scenario, if there is no part being built by the printer and if there is no part set in the queue of the printer, the control panel display an \u201cIdle\u201d status. Similarly, if the printer has a part in queue to be build, the display message on the panel changes to \u201cStart Part\u201d status. There are several similar steps that transition from one to the other illustrated in figure 2 as a flow chart that are embedded into the virtual simulator. Figure 2. The flowchart of uPrint SE Plus 3D printer used to replicate into the Virtual Simulator To provide a user rich and immersive experience, two major steps were involved in developing the simulator. The first step was to extract the 3-dimensional model of the printer itself i.e. in this case the model of uPrint SE plus 3D printer. However, to replicate the printer actions in the simulator the model had to be transferred to a file compatible with a programming language. The 3D model of the printer was created in SolidWorks software (shown in Figure 3). Later involved using this model to replicate the printer\u2019s actions with the help of a programing interface. This included saving the 3D model developed using solid works to a standard vrml97 format which was then converted to a .x file compatible with c-sharp programing language. Illustrated in figure 4 are the 3D model and its conversion to .X file. Figure 3. uPrint SE plus 3D model developed in SolidWorks software Figure 4. uPrint SE plus 3D model in (a) VRML 97 and (b) X file The virtual simulator was initially developed to run on Windows and Mac-OS platform computers however; with the intention to extend this simulator to be used on mobile based platforms such as tablets and cell phones, visual studio was used to develop a graphical user interface (GUI). Figure 5 illustrates the screen shots of the beta version of mobile compatible uPrint simulator. Figure 5. Screenshots of mobile beta version of the uPrint simulator uPrint Simulator for Additive Manufacturing Learning With the main goal of the simulator development being enhancing student educational experience, especially to improve student learning in Additive Manufacturing domain, the authors looked to understand the influence of the tool in student learning compared to traditional approach. This tool was integrated to the course titled \u201c3D Printing: Basics and Applications\u201d at IMSE UTEP. The course was designed to deal with various aspects of additive and subtractive application ranging from prototyping to production. A major emphasis was on using AM technologies for direct manufacturing of end-user parts. The Student Learning outcomes (SLOs) of the course at its completion were for each student to be able to: \u2022Provide a comprehensive overview of 3D Printing technologies including descriptions of related technologies including design and 3DP-specific software and post-processing/part finishing approaches. \u2022Discuss the wide variety of new and emerging applications like micro-scale 3DP, medical applications, direct printing of electronics and directly manufacturing end-use components. \u2022Explain the capabilities, limitations, and basic principles of alternative 3DP technologies. \u2022Evaluate and select appropriate 3DP technologies for specific applications. \u2022Apply 3DP techniques (including CAD) to a challenging rapid manufacturing application. \u2022Identify, explain, and prioritize some of the important research challenges in 3DP. To analyze student learning outcomes and towards understanding student learning effectiveness, the legacy virtual simulator FDM 3000 (see Tseng et al, 2014 for more details on FDM 3000 simulator) that was previously developed at IMSE UTEP was used in order to compare the influence of the new RP simulator in AM learning.

In addition, they often rely on users inputting relevant data repetitively. Implicit interaction is a possible solution to improve the user experience of car-related interfaces. Basic user tasks for many car applications are (i) reporting parking the car in a specific position, (ii) declaring that the user will soon free a parking spot, and (iii) that a new trip with the car has begun (thus, that a parking spot became free).

Dialectical analysis on current situations concerning the toy market and service and the methods of investigation and interview were taken to analyze a series of problems concerning interaction behaviors between relevant products and users, such as difficulty of selection, excessive amounts of operator interface, relatively low amounts of optional product content, low attraction of product presentation, and so on. The author tried to take the interfaces of service systems as the carries, and present a systematic scheme to solve problems concerning toy waste and user interaction behaviors. The design of the shared toy service system was an attempt based on user interaction behavior as well as effective discussion on solutions to market-available toy-concerned problems, and shows high practical significance and service value. By integrating with the hot topic of \u201csharing economy\u201d in today\u2019s society and starting from the current situation of services, problems concerning user interaction, such as assisted user selection, operation pages, presentation methods, etc., were deeply explored in the paper to summarize the functions and modes of the service systems and thereby to propose the interfacial design of a shared toy service system. Keywords\u2014industrial design, Interaction design, Interface design, Shared patterns, Toys, Service system Toys are necessities in children\u2019s growing process [1]. Good toys not only bring happiness to children, but also develop their intelligence, stimulate imagination, build up manipulative ability and promote their healthy growth. However, in the face of the ever-changing world with wide toy varieties, many parents have same troubles--the variety of toys and the prices are increasing, children\u2019s curiosity is gradually rising, and children are faster in \u201cabandoning the old for the new\u201d. Consequently, parents buy new toys to satisfy their kids\u2019 desires, while constant accumulation of new and old new toys results in great wastes, since it is unnecessary to keep all toys, but it is wasteful to abandoning them. In view of the situation and in combination with the currently hot topic of \u201csharing economy\u201d in the society [2], a toy sharing platform is created to alleviate the social problem. Based on the universal phenomenon, toy rental in a shared way will effectively ease the problem of toy waste. There are similar mobile APP-based service platforms available in the market, but there are many problems concerning their industrial designs. From a new perspective, the author tried to explore the interaction design of the toy rental service system based on multiple age brackets of infants and young children. I. A SIMPLE INTRODUCTION ON PRESENT CONDITION OF CHILDREN'S TOY MARKET AND SERVICES A. The State of Children's Toy Market Generally, toys can be classified into metal, plastic, cotton, electronic, paper and other groups according to their raw materials. Since cotton and velvet toys are susceptible to be stained and cannot be cleaned simply and paper toys are inclined to be damaged, suitable toys for rental are mainly metal, plastic and electronic products. With the continuous growths of social economy and people\u2019s consumption power, the amount of discarded toy has also increased with the rising of purchasing volume. As children grow older, some toys might be no longer suitable for them, or children might no longer like some toys after a period of time, and the amounts of unused and discarded toys also increase [3]. Besides, with the growth in the living standard, people have been posing increasingly high requirements on the quality, safety and function of toys [4], and the prices of toys keep increasing. People are at their wit\u2019s end trying to dispose purchased high-end toys. According to the statistics of China\u2019s toy market scale, it can be seen that families are spend more and more money on toys. Therefore, the toy sharing APP designed in combination with \u201csharing economy\u201d mode will allow constant recycles and reuses of toys, reduce the terrible waste of toy resources in families, and surely be welcomed by parents. See Table I. TABLE I. STATISTICS OF CHINA\u2019S TOY MARKET SCALE AND THE PREDICTION Year Population of 0-14 YO (10,000) Domestic Sales (0.1 Billion CNY) Export Amount (0.1 Billion CNY) Per Capita Toy Expenditure (CNY) 2013 22315.81 564.61 804.77 253.01 2014 22555.35 582.40 918.91 258.21 2015 24193.31 649.48 973.50 268.45 2016 24898.99 707.01 1067.79 283.95 2017 25837.75 759.18 1152.16 293.83 B. Analysis of Current Toy Sharing APP Service Toy sharing, also known as toy rentals , is an economic behavior of toy-based physical credit. Based on the economic behavior, a lessee has the right to use a toy for a certain period of time by paying a certain fee, while the ownership of the toy is still owned by the lessor. In the current market, there are three relatively well-known toy rental APPs --Wanduoduo (Fig. 2), 2018 8th International Conference on Education, Management, Computer and Society (EMCS 2018) Copyright \u00a9 (2018) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/emcs.2018.062 248 Toy Superman (Fig. 3) and More One (Fig. 4). But the popularities of these three APPs are not high, and many people are not very familiar with the manner of toy rental. By analyzing these three applications, it can be seen that their value the safety of disinfection. Moreover, it is suggested by the user research that safety is the primary consideration when selecting a toy. Therefore, a toy sharing APP should put the safety of disinfection and hygiene in the first place, and offer its users with a safe and secure concept to allow users to better use its products in a more secure way. Based on the them, the processes of booking, returning and lease-renewing can be done online, reducing the troubles of no-site operation and back-and-forth visits. In addition, all the three APPs distinguish age groups and toy types in detail, try to cover maximal age groups and toy types, provide more options, and maximize service time and age levels for users. However, the three APPs also have some shortcomings. Their offline services are limited by the geographical factor; delivery cannot be offered if a user is beyond a certain geographic distance, and it increases the use difficulty for users. Besides, since the three products are featured by burdensome operational procedures and relatively complicated user experience, there is still large room for improvement. It can be known from these three APPs that the design of a toy sharing APP should reduce the operation difficulty, simplify the interface content, provide users with more concise and direct choices, and offer better user experience. See Table II. Fig. 2. Games to play Fig. 3.Superman Toys Fig. 4.Sharing Toys TABLE II. ANALYSIS ON ADVANTAGES AND DEFECTS OF TOY SHARING APPS AND DESIGN INNOVATION POINTS Advantages of Existing Products Defects of Existing Products Design Innovation Points Complete Disinfection Process Deficiency of Package Content; A Low Amount of Choice Customizable Exclusive Toy Package All user operations can be completed online. Offline services are significantly affected by the geographical factor. Comprehensive Package Choices Detailed Division of Age Groups and Toy Types Burdensome and Complicated Operational Procedures Simple and Convenient Operational Procedures II. ELEMENTS OF USER INTERACTION BEHAVIOR A. Target Users Users are the objects of products and services provided by an enterprise or merchant. The different age groups and consumption abilities of users lead to different consumption behaviors. In this sense, the content carried by a product must meet users\u2019 different needs as comprehensively as possible. Regarding a toy sharing APP, the interactive content should satisfy parents\u2019 purchasing needs, such as type requirement, brand requirement, targeted age ranges corresponding to toy choices, simple operations for selection, safe purchasing, identifiable content buttons, etc. Among the existing toy rental APPs available on the market, only a very few APPs offer customized toy packages to reduce the selection difficulty, and these packages are characterized by low content volumes and deficient orientation. Based on the problem, this APP is designed with additional customized toy packages and customized package services to reduce selection difficulty. In child-bearing families, many parents, especially new parents, have no idea about how to buy and choose toys that are suitable for and preferred by children. Therefore, we should use the designed product to provide parents with more professional guidance on toy selection and to reduce ubiquitous the problem of toy waste in families. B. Behavior of Users User behavior consists of five elements--time, place, person, interaction and interactive content. When a user is using an APP, he/she wants to obtain contents he/she needs quickly during the search and browsing process. Therefore, a toy sharing APP shall be simplified for its operational steps to the most to reduce the difficulty of user operation. During the operation", "year": 2019}

Ivan Sutherland created first VR and AR headmounted display in 1968 called The Sword of Damocles, to develop an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers (Sutherland, I. E, 1965). AR was initially experienced in a lab, but the advancement and affordability of smartphones have sparked a resurgence of interest in mobile AR applications. With the launch of the Pok\u00e9mon mobile AR game in 2016, there has been renewed excitement from users to experience AR games via their mobile devices (McCartney, M, 2016). This creates the opportunity to design and explore AR platform games for enhancing creativity. The transformative aspects of this technology are its ability to enhance creativity playing with virtual objects. The intent of this project is to enhance creativity by using AR platform to overlay virtual game object over the real world. This will teach players to take a different approach to connect game objects of different textures to randomly generated objects to create block structures of player imagination. Introduction: There are few block building games like Minecraft (Persson, M., & Bergensten, J, 2011), development platform games like Roblox which uses blocks to create virtual world (Baszucki, D. B., & Cassel, E. S,2011) but it limits users within the scope of the virtual world they build. AR will create an opportunity to imagine what they build in the real world and think from a different perspective. For example, the Babel Build game Spross, M. C. (2013), which used large building blocks to build tower kind structures in public helped in breaking normal social barriers but still does not make use of AR. AR will help the players to connect virtual object overlaying with the physical world. This will help them to enhance creativity as the build. Papert, S. (1980) stated that constructionist learning is when one learns to construct mental models to understand the world around them. For example, rather than lecture based learning, students learn through participating in project-based learning where they effectively make the connection between different ideas. In another example, it is proved that playing and making games for learning helped in developing creative models (Kafai, Y. B, 2006). Kafai, Y. B., & Resnick, M. (1996) proposed and evaluated an approach to developing a constructionism in practice by designing, thinking, and learning in a digital world. This was an exploration is an effective approach that cultivates creativity and improves practical abilities. Feiner, S., Macintyre, B., & Seligmann, D, (1993) study on Knowledge-based augmented reality describes that students showed interest to learn more about the subject. Similarly, another study by Klopfer & Yoon, 2004 results showed that augmented reality foster student creativity and imagination. The immersion, interaction and navigation features of AR improve user\u2019s motivation to learn, assist with knowledge comprehension, and is potentially useful in learning task that requires experiments, spatial ability, and collaboration (Dalgarno & Lee, 2010; Di Serio, Ibanez, & Kloos, 2013; Dunleavy, Dede, & Mitchell, 2009). Since in AR we overlay the game with the real world, the creative design process can be improved by considering the environmental influence. Ambaline and Kramer (2003) stated that the external motivation like environment factor was influenced greatly when they were engaged in the outdoor activity and their outcome were more likely to be creative if they applied their creative skills. The environment will be more supportive in terms of information, opportunities, freedom when they think. Additionally, Squire and Klopfler (2008) stated when users played a virtual game outdoor resulted in making a much more informative decision considering the surrounding environment. Users can master the domainrelevant knowledge of creativity design using AR (Maclntyre, Gandy, Dow & Bolter, 2004). Moreover, implementing AR can reduce the cost of the design process as it is extensively being used in prototyping process (Nee, Ong, Chryssolouris, & Mourtzis, 2012) to improve product design. AR will also be helpful in assembly, maintain and layout planning and other manufacturer activities (Li, Xi, Yu & Fung 2004; Ong & Nee, 2004). For example, AR was used in interior design to visualize creative interior d\u00e9cor (Phan & Choo, 2010). The interest in the mobile AR application for viewing 3D objects in the real world is increasing with increased number of smartphones. Current smartphones and tablets possess fast processing with graphic hardware, a large touch screen and various onboard sensor like in the built-in camera, GPS, compass and accelerometer making them ideal for indoor, outdoor experience and portability (Billinghurst & Dunser, 2012). Additionally, AR enables viewing of 3D objects in the physical world or real world which allows one to visualise how it would look with other surrounding effects (Arvanitis et al., 2007; Dunleavy et al., 2009). About the Game: Block Sculptures is an augmented reality block building game. The main goal of the game is to connect each block to reach the randomly generated cube. Cubes with different textures are the main building blocks of the game. To load the game, the player scans a target AR image. A transparent plane, the playing area, will be loaded, and a cube will be generated in a random location on the plane. The goal is to build a structure out of blocks to reach the randomly generated cube. This is done by placing a cube anywhere within the playing area, provided it is adjacent to another cube, until they connect the plane to the randomly generated cube to end the game. Design and Development: I Implemented the game design and development through an Iterative prototyping approach. I developed a rapid prototype design model by designing, incrementally adding, and testing new mechanics, starting with a simple feature. For each implementation, a new prototype iteration was created and tested, each with one new feature added. Game user research methods such as retrospective interview, think aloud protocol and observing players during the playtest helped to identify and understand the player experience. This also helped in making the gameplay more enjoyable. Finally, the MDA framework was used to understand the game mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics (Hunicke, R., LeBlanc, M., & Zubek, R, 2004). This helped me bridge gap between design and development process. By dissecting the game into mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics, the game development process was strengthened. To develop an augmented reality game, I used Vuforia plugin in Unity 3D game engine. By using Vuforia application we can store the target image in Vuforia database and load the game objects when we scan the target image from our phones. I then used the target image as the base to spawn game objects dynamically. The idea was to develop different game objects dynamically and encourage users to design and development using the game objects by overlaying it with the real world. Additionally, the base image was developed to look like a transparent plane, which gives the player a seamless overlay over the physical world and helps the player to place the block on the plane. Players can play the game anywhere with the mobile if they have the target image to load the game. Finally, the game was built and tested on an android mobile device (can be built for IOS, Windows and HoloLens). Design Iterations: The features that were incrementally added with each iteration were as follows: 1. loading a base image by scanning target image using Vuforia, Generating and Positioning of game objects on the plane of Base image 2. Transparent plane and gravity to game objects 3. Different types of textured game objects and selection UI 4. Random game object spawning and UI Each iteration had three phases of testing: \uf0b7 Phase 1 Self test \uf0b7 Phase 2 Playtest with 4 friends \uf0b7 Phase 3 Playtest with 5 strangers Iteration 1Build with white blocks In playtesting one, loading a base image by scanning target image using Vuforia and cube generation was implemented. In phase one, testing was performed to verify that the core game mechanics of generating cubes was working. Also, I verified if the base image was loading on scanning the target image. In phase two, all 4 participants could spawn game objects on the base image created. Most of them created randomly arranged collections of game objects on the base image. The following observations were made by using think-aloud protocol and player interaction during the testing. It was observed that the players had no excitement because the game lacked to challenge them but they just built randomly shaped models like layouts and buildings. In phase three, the participant had no idea about augmented reality, they were excited at the start of the game but I observed that the players eventually become bored of the gameplay. Iteration 2 \u2013 Gravity and transparent plane base image. In the second iteration, I added gravity to the game objects to check if players had fun and a transparent base image to overlay with the physical layer. In phase one, I tested if the transparent base image loaded when target image was scanned. Secondly, I verified if the changes made in the second iteration had any impact on the present build. Finally, testing was done to check if the basic functionality implemented in build one were working and verified if gravity was added to the game objects that were generated. In phase two and three, it was observed through interaction that the players had fun creating game objects, but it was observed that players were facing difficulty in constructing what they wanted to build. More linear models were developed and players took ma", "year": 2017}

As far as E-tailing context is concerned, retaining a large base of loyal customers is the only way to ensure profitability and sustainability of the business. By understanding various facets of ORS and their impact on Consumer Based Brand Equity (CBBE), E-tailers will be in the position to use various customer directed services strategically. The philosophy of ORS will enable E-tailers to bring about differentiation in their service tactics in such a way that customers will perceive those differentiations as unique and attractive. Here, the researcher tries to discover important factors which are hidden behind a set of service tactics that an E-tailer can use. This will enable an E-tailer to have a clear insight over the way in which customers fundamentally perceive its service tactics. Moreover, the researcher also tries to analyse how these factors impact CBBE. As CBBE reveals the worthiness of an E-tailer as a brand in the eyes of customers, this aspect of analysis assumes a significant importance. With a help of the factor analysis, the factors in connection with ORS have been identified and subsequently, a model has been developed, by running a multiple regression analysis, to identify the factors that have a significant impact on the Consumer Based Brand Equity (CBBE) of E-tailers. Keyword: Online Retail Service (ORS), Consumer Based Brand Equity (CBBE) and E-tailers E-commerce Industry in India The Indian e-commerce market is expected to grow to US$ 200 billion by 2026 from US$ 38.5 billion as of 2017, growing at an annual rate of 51 per cent, the highest in the world. (IBEF, 2019) [9] . Much growth of the industry has been triggered by increasing internet and smartphone penetration. The ongoing digital transformation in the country is expected to increase India\u2019s total internet user base to 829 million by 2021 from 636.73 million in FY19. India\u2019s internet economy is expected to double from US$ 125 billion as of April 2017 to US$ 250 billion by 2020. Online retail sales in India touched US$ 32.70 billion in 2018, led by Flipkart, Amazon India and Paytm Mall. During 2018, electronics is currently the biggest contributor to online retail sales in India with a share of 48 per cent, followed closely by apparel at 29 per cent. Online shoppers in India are expected to reach 220 million by 2025 from 120 million in 2018. E-tailers now deliver to 15,000-20,000 pin codes out of nearly 100,000 pin codes in the country. Online retail is expected to contribute 2.9 per cent of retail market in 2018. By 2022, smartphone users are expected to reach 859 million and e-commerce sector expected to grow 1,200 per cent by 2026. In FY20, internet penetration in India was 50.52 per cent. A young demographic profile, rising internet penetration and relative better economic performance are the key drivers of this sector. The Government of India's policies and regulatory frameworks such as 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in B2B e-commerce and 100 per cent FDI under automatic route under the marketplace model of B2C e-commerce are expected to further propel growth in the sectors. As per the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, online entities through foreign investments cannot offer the products which are sold by retailers in which they hold equity stake. In February 2019, the Government of India released the Draft National E-Commerce Policy which encourages FDI in the marketplace model of e-commerce. Further, it states that the FDI policy for e-commerce sector has been developed to ensure a level playing field for all participants.

Value creation and delivery play a vital role in increasing the size of loyal customers. It has also significant positive impact on Brand Equity. Pre and after sales service space throws open many avenues through which E-tailers can create and deliver value to customers and build a long term relationship with customers . Online retail/services (ORS) is one of the important philosophies that focuses on creating and delivering value through service aspects of E-tailers. Christodoulides.G, De Chernatony, Furrer.O, Shiu.E, and Abimbola.T (2006) [6] were pioneers in studies related to ORS. According to them ORS is defined as a \u201crelational type of intangible asset that is co-created through the interaction between consumers and the Etail Brand. Given the proliferation of E-tailers and increasing number of online shoppers in India, testing ORS and its impact on online brand equity is need of the hour as this would enable the E-tailers to build their brand equity through ORS.

They defined the ORS as\u201d A relational type of intangible asset that is co-created through the interaction between consumers and the e-tail brand\u201d. Their main focus was to measure brand equity in an online context by taking into account the unique characteristics of the internet that made consumers as co-creators of brand value. They came up with 12-item brand equity scale that encompassed all dimensions of the ORS.

A key feature of this board is its custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based synchronization method, which ensures alignment accuracy of 170 ps between the channels, enabling precise frequency and phase relationship settings. In addition, the DDS board incorporates a user-friendly web interface that allows for continuous control and monitoring capabilities over TCP/IP. Multiple synchronized channels can be power-combined to produce a low-phase noise output due to coherent addition of the common carriers and the noncoherent addition of the residual DDS noise. By exploiting these principles and combining eight parallel channels of two DDS boards, we achieve exceptional residual phase noise performance, with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathscr {L}(1 \\text {Hz}) = -147 \\text {dBc/Hz}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathscr {L}(100 \\text {kHz}) = -180 \\text {dBc/Hz}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for a 9.765625 MHz output signal.

A query subtopic is often defined, as distinct information need relevant to the original query. We deal with the problem of discovering query facets, which are several groups of words or phrases that make clear, and review the content enclosed by a query. We believe that the significant aspects of a query are usually presented and recurred in the query\u2019s peak retrieved documents in the style of lists, and query facets can be mined out by aggregating these important lists. We propose an organized answer, which we refer to as QDMiner, to automatically supply query facets by extracting and grouping recurrent lists from free text, HTML tags, and duplicate regions within top search results. Experimental outcome show that a big number of lists are present and QDMiner can mine valuable query facets. We further analyze the problem of list duplication, and find modeling fine-grained similarities between lists and punishing the duplicated lists can mine superior query facets. KeywordsQuery facet, faceted search, summarization, user intent. I. INTRODUCTION Query facet is derived by analyzing the text query .It allows the users to explore collection of information by applying multiple filters. Faceted search / Faceted navigation is a technique for accessing information organized according to a faceted classification system. Query facets provide interesting and useful knowledge about a query. It improves search experiences. Query facet generates significant aspects from a large list of queries based on a particular product/ services. Facets access a recommendation for searched users. Automatically mine query facets that exhibit the characteristics of product/ service. A query may have multiple facets that summarize information from a query from different perspectives. We recommend a methodical solution, which we refer to as QDMiner, to automatically mine query facets by extracting and combination frequent lists from free text, HTML tags, and replicate regions within top search results. The lists can be grouped into clusters based on the items they contain, then ranks the clusters and items based on how the list and items appear in the top results. WQT (Quality Threshold with Weighted data points) is the clustering algorithm used to group high quality weighted list first. To rank query facets two models are to be used, the Unique Website Model and the Context Similarity Model. Purpose of this project is to improve the search experiences for the user and build a system that automatically mines query facets for open domain queries easily. II. RELATED WORK A. Extending faceted search to the general web, W. Kong and J. Allan In this paper, we proposed Faceted Web Search, an extension of faceted search to the general Web. We studied different facet generation and facet feedback models based on our proposed extrinsic evaluation, which directly measures the utility in search instead of comparing system/annotator facets as in intrinsic evaluation. Extracting query subtopics (or aspects) is similar to generating facets for queries. A query subtopic is often defined, as distinct information need relevant to the original query. Our experiments show, by using facet feedback from users, Faceted Web Search is able to assist the search task and significantly improve ranking performance. Comparing intrinsic evaluation and extrinsic evaluation on different facet generation models, we find that the intrinsic evaluation does not always reflect system utility in real application. Comparing different facet feedback models, we find that the Boolean filtering models, which are widely used in conventional faceted search, are too strict in Faceted Web Search, and less effective than soft ranking models.

Our first extension adds flexible, dynamic business intelligence aggregations to the faceted application, enabling users to gain insight into their data that is International Journal for Research in Applied Science & Engineering Technology (IJRASET) ISSN: 2321-9653; IC Value: 45.98; SJ Impact Factor:6.887 Volume 5 Issue IX, September 2017Available at www.ijraset.com 330 \u00a9IJRASET (UGC Approved Journal): All Rights are Reserved far richer than just knowing the quantities of documents belonging to each facet. We see this capability as a step toward bringing OLAP capabilities, traditionally supported by databases over relational data, to the domain of free-text queries over metadata-rich content. Our second extension shows how one can efficiently extend a faceted search engine to support correlated facets a more complex information model in which the values associated with a document across multiple facets are not independent. By reducing the problem to a recently solved tree-indexing scenario, data with correlated facets can be efficiently indexed and retrieved. C. Automatic extraction of useful Facet hierarchies from text databases, W. Dakka and P. G. Ipeirotis. Faceted interfaces uses different orthogonal classification schemes to present in a database has been increasing worldwide. Many websites (such as YouTube, The New York Times,\u2028 eBay, and Google Base)function on top of large database and offer a large type of services. In this paper, we represent an unsupervised\u2028method for automatic extraction of facets useful for browsing text databases. In order to support such exploratory interactions, the majority of the websites mentioned above use a form of concept hierarchies to support browsing on top of large sets of items. Commonly, a single hierarchy or a taxonomy that organizes thematically the contents of the database supports browsing. Unfortunately, a single hierarchy can very rarely organize the contents of database. This paper work on the automatic construction of multifaceted interfaces contributes to the development of databases. The distributional analysis step of our technique automatically identifies which concepts are important for the underlying database and generates the appropriate facet terms. Finally, we compare the term distributions in the original database and the expanded database to identify the terms that can be used to construct browsing facets. Our extensive user studies, using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service, show that our techniques produce facet switch high precision and recall that are superior to existing approaches and help users locate interesting items faster. We plan to perform more experiments in this direction and examine the performance of our techniques for a larger variety of text databases and external resources. D.

MODULES DESCRIPTION A. List and context extraction From each document d in the search result set R, we extract a set of lists Ld from the HTML content of d based on three different types of patterns, namely free text patterns, HTML tag patterns, and repeat region patterns. For each extract list, we extract its container node together with the previous and next sibling of the container node as its context. We define that a container node of a list is the lowest common ancestor of the nodes containing the items in the list. 1) Free Text Patterns Texts and Textp: It extracts all text within document d and split it into sentences. We then employ the pattern item {, item}* (and/or) {other} item, which is similar to extract matched items from each sentence. Example: shopping for gorgeous watches from Seiko, Lucien Piccard, Citizen, and Cartier. We further use the pattern {^item (: j-) .+$}+ to extract lists from some semi-structured paragraphs. It extracts lists from continuous lines that are comprised of two parts separated by a dash or a colon. The first parts of these lines are extracted as a list. 2) HTML Tag Patterns-HTML TAG: To extracts lists from several list-style HTML tags, including SELECT, UL, OL, and TABLE. We named these simple HTML tag based patterns as HTMLTAG. a) SELECT For the SELECT tag; simply extract all text from their child tags (OPTION) to create a list. Moreover, it removes the first item if it starts with some predefined text, such as \u201cselect\u201d or \u201cchoose\u201d. b) UL/OL For these two tags, it also simply extracts text within their child ", "year": 2017}

To evaluate the usability of VR prototypes projects apply a variety of methods either single-perspective or hybrid methods. The literature suggests that hybrid methods produce more complete sets of requirements by highlighting both \u2018in-world\u2019 and user interface problems. The paper describes our experiences in using a single-perspective method that is a modified version of a Cognitive Walkthrough method for gathering user requirements in the REVERIE (Real and Virtual Engagement In Realistic Immersive Environment) project. We asked six experts to evaluate two hybrid VR prototypes with an educational context. As the software prototypes were in an early beta stage, we augmented them using storyboards and videos to simulate the missing user tasks. Also, we asked experts to get \u201cinto the shoes\u201d of three archetypical users (represented as personas) while completing tasks with the prototypes. We found that our methodology was effective in highlighting a plethora of usability problems covering all aspects of the two prototypes. The identified problems were translated into 47 new requirements and prioritised based on the MoSCoW prioritization method. Most of the problems discovered were considered as essential in solving in the next design iteration of the software prototypes. Also, none of the problems discovered was considered as it was not a usability problem and hence, it should not be translated into a requirement. The performance of our methodology (single-perspective method and hybrid prototypes) was similar to hybrid methods. It also provided the foundation to develop a new method for the prioritisation of user requirements. Overall, we can conclude that using our methodology may provide a viable alternative to hybrid methods when it is required (e.g., when the expertise needed to use a hybrid method is not available). The paper concludes with a discussion of future work that focusses on integrating better training for experts and additional user groups in the evaluation process.", "year": 2018}

What\u2019s lagging behind is their ability to convert that site traffic into new business. Average conversion rates are in most cases alarmingly low and, by physical store measures, practically suicidal. It is no surprise then that the marketing technology scene is booming with providers who obsess over driving conversion rates and online sales up. One of the most prominent solution categories in the space is chatbots and other conversational interfaces, which can be used as the corporate website\u2019s lead generation and sales engine, customer service function, and to bring overall enhancements to the online customer experience. Chatbots are by no means a new innovation, but they have so far received little direct academic attention. More explored themes in the same domain include website interactivity, the state of flow and concepts related to online consumer behavior. This thesis contributes to the existing bodies of research by studying the effectiveness of chatbots on three live company websites with a true experimental research design. More specifically, the focus is on discovering how chatbot identity (brand \u2013 human) and tone of voice (formal \u2013 casual) influence the effectiveness of chatbot conversations in terms of conversions and engagement in dialogue. Findings from three conducted studies give no conclusive answer to whether a bot with a branded or human identity, or formal or casual tone of voice performs more effectively than its counterpart. In some of the experiments, human identity and casual tone yield the best results, but in others, tables are turned in favor of a branded identity and formal tone of voice, or one of the other combinations. Even though the variants do not in all cases produce significantly different results, there is solid indication that choices related to bot identity and tone of voice matter. Conclusions of the thesis suggest that the choice between a branded or human bot identity and formal or casual tone of voice should be made with the specific brand in mind. Furthermore, it is found that bot variants behave differently when placed in different stages of the buyer\u2019s journey. There is also evidence that suggests a categorical difference in user preferences between the contexts of B2B and B2C. These and other observations are listed as potential avenues for future research. Overall, the set of mixed findings stresses the importance of understanding customers\u2019 needs and motivations, as well as their relationship with and expectations toward the brand. When the chatbot succeeds in addressing users\u2019 most pressing questions, it presents an attractive proposition for improving the website conversion rate and customer experience. But structure alone is not enough \u2013 results of the conducted studies show that matching the bot\u2019s identity and tone of voice with the brand is a reliable source of beneficial behavioral outcomes.", "year": 2020}

It becomes an inevitable choice for traditional enterprise to break the shackles, implement the strategy of crossover operation based on the internet, and to find a new mode of value creation. This paper takes traditional enterprise as the research object, bases on its current development situation and the dilemma of value creation as the research present situation. The value create model based on the internet crossover operation strategy is proposed so that traditional enterprise can be out of the plight, and help traditional enterprise achieve the transformation of development. 1. The traditional model of enterprise value creation and their plight Enterprise value creation model refers to a model of effective value creation of enterprise, which takes value maximization as the goal, combines resource and ability of enterprise and organizes value creation activities through economic management means, in order to realize the whole value creation process. Traditional model of enterprise value creation is numerous, although different scholars\u2019 points of view of the value creation patterns vary. In general, the value chain model proposed by Michael porter is more applied. It illustrates the type of value activities and reveals its relationship with the profits. Most of the traditional enterprise value creation activities are in internal production and sales link and directly create value for the enterprise. In recent years, essence change has taken place in consumer access to information, behavior and consumption habits due to the rapid development of internet, especially the rapid rise of the mobile internet. According to CNNIC published in July 2016, the 38  shows the number of Chinese internet users reached 710 million, mobile phone network user 656 million, nearly 200 million rural users. By June 2016, the Chinese site number 4.54 million. It shows that the internet penetration rate is very high in our country. Among them mobile internet shows its dominance and strong momentum of development. While the traditional enterprise unable to adapt to the new market environment, its development is slower. The lack of ability to adapt mainly includes: 1.1. Lack in understanding electronic commerce Traditional enterprise simply takes the e-commerce as the internet sales, it won't have too much impact on the traditional enterprise, instead of its changing the whole traditional supply chain. And on the internet, companies need more is the terminal consumer demand as the guidance of the sales process, that is, e-commerce can production and sales, you can even use a design draft for sales, such as booking on some famous online store of Taobao.com. 2017 International Conference on Financial Management, Education and Social Science (FMESS 2017) Copyright \u00a9 (2017) Francis Academic Press , UK 103 1.2. Focusing on advertising instead of experience utility Traditional enterprises are accustomed to use high density and mass media advertising, but the internet age, information transfer is fast without barriers, businesses and consumers are almost equal in access to information, enterprise value cannot be improved by traditional advertising, while experiential marketing is the main force in the internet age. Such as the \"shiyong.com\" founded in 2006, is a free platform for user to trial product, which has hundreds of registered users in just two months. Users in the tested product or service must be submitted after the trial result, obtain market and customer data for the manufacturer. Its main income comes from the manufacturer. Its characteristic is \"try\" and \"experience\", these two features have a great influence to the Chinese psychology, also is the key to the development of it. 1.3. Loss efficiency of traditional mode The point of traditional mode of enterprise value creation is to reduce cost, but for now operating costs have become so low that it cannot be further lowered. The corresponding strategy of the internet, however, has more timeliness, broad audience, especially the digital technology to optimize the customer relationship, increased the convenience of customers. At the same time, companies also can analyze the huge amounts of data obtained via the internet, and then observe the user behavior, adjust the goods or services at the same time, to get more valuable before reaching the customer. Traditional enterprise value model does seem lack of efficiency in the face of such impact. 2. Internet-based crossover operation strategy Crossover operation is a relatively new term; often appear at news headlines, such as: crossborder cooperation, cross-border marketing and so on. The definitions and related data of crossover operation can be collected in the literature and very few in numbers. Although cross-border management theory is not much, but it is very wide application in practical, and even has become one of the most common enterprise management paradigm. About the defining of internet crossover operation strategy, there are no scholars put forward a clear definition, only some successful experience in the enterprise practice. After analyzing, sorting and induction, here is its definition. internet crossover operation strategy refers to the enterprises break through the boundaries of the original management field, relying on the internet platform, combine the internet and traditional enterprise management field, use existing resources and the internet resources as a whole, and to find and create a new multidimensional value growth on the enterprise value chain, seek the further development of the enterprise. Internet crossover operation strategy means to break the traditional enterprise strategic management model, get rid of the shackles of existing management field and bondage, seek to work closely with internet resources, and thus it can achieve a synergistic effect, create value for the enterprise. At present, the application of internet-based cross-border operation strategy is very much; the type of internet-based crossover operation strategy in the enterprise management practice mainly as following: 2.1. Product/service-based internet crossover operation strategy Product-based internet crossover operation strategy refers to the business scope of enterprise cross-border mainly concentrated in the field of products. Such as: Kangmei pharmaceutical co., LTD. (stock code: 600518) breaks through the original main business products-traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), operates from proprietary Chinese medicine to establishing electric business platform about Chinese medicine resources, looking for value creation in the new electricity field, become Chinese medicine enterprise cross-border electricity rookie. This is implemented of internet crossover operation strategy based on the product/service.", "year": 2017}

Customer service is an integral part of any organization. Over the past few years, customer satisfaction and technology have become conjoined. Customers today are demanding more and more techno-savvy service that will provide quick and efficient service that will keep pace with the ever changing technological world. The water reticulation system in Mombasa is old and dilapidated and is prone to leaks and bursts. Coupled with this fact is the challenge of illegal connections done by unscrupulous persons who connect to the system unprofessionally leading to leaks. Leaks and bursts may go for days an end without being reported leading to excessive loss of water. However, residents are lax in reporting leaks in their areas and have tended to ignore the issue either out of ignorance or lethargy to report the issue. There appears to be lack of effective communication between the utility and the customers which needs to be addressed. Water services by the Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company (MOWASSCO) thus continue to be unsatisfactory given the key challenge of financial sustainability. Poor services invariably affects the degree of customer satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to establish the role of electronic water monitoring systems in increasing customer satisfaction with services provided by the Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company, despite the several challenges in water service provision as outlined. This research used descriptive survey where the target population totaling 600 was drawn from the five water meter reading zones in Mombasa County namely Island North, Island South, Likoni, Nyali and West Mainland. The study used primary data which was gathered using structured questionnaires. Chapter one dealt with a background of the study including a background of the water supply system and its challenges. A synopsis of customer satisfaction in public institution was given together with a brief of the water supply in Mombasa. A statement of the problem described in depth the current challenges encountered by MOWASSCO in its service delivery. The chapter also gave an insight into the use of technology in enhancing customer satisfaction. Chapter two analyzed the literature review with emphasis on adoption of technology in the service industry and also outlined the conceptual framework. Chapter three outlined the research methodology, while Chapter four analyzed the data and derived conclusions. Data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression, presented in tables and pie charts extracted from both MS Excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software tools version 20.Lastly, Chapter five gave a summary of the study, conclusions, recommendations and further research. \u00a9 2017 Elixir All rights reserved.

Global customer satisfaction Customer satisfaction is a marketing term which measures how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation. It can also be looked at as the number of customers, or percentage of total customers, whose reported experience with a firm, its products, or its services (in other word \u201cthe ratings\u201d) exceeds specified satisfaction goals. Customer satisfaction is seen as a key performance indicator within business and is a key item of the Balanced Scorecard (Alsyouf, 2006). In a competitive marketplace where businesses compete for customers, customer satisfaction is seen as a key differentiator and increasingly has become a key element of business strategy. Unlike in the public sector, the private sector upholds customer satisfaction and loyalty \u2013 which is secured through high\u2010quality products and services which meet customer needs and which provide value for money. This is seen as essential for survival of business. In the public sector the concepts of service quality, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty have not been a priority mainly because public services have a built\u2010in customer base (Akinboade, Kinfack, & Mokwena, 2012). According to Van de Wall (2016) public services tend not to go out of business and the abolishment or closing down of a public organization is fairly rare. Van de Wall (2016) goes on to add that many public services are even successful when their customer base shrinks, either because the problem they have are created for is solved, or because they have been successful in discouraging clients of whom many are involuntary clients. In the recent past, technology has been setting pace in customer service on a global scale. In the last few decades, IT applications have changed the landscape of the service industry (Kaushik &Rahman, 2015). One of the key contributors to future marketing success, for both large and small firms alike, will be the exploitation of electronic gadgets, which will facilitate the use and management of information. Through the use of such gadgets, institutions are presently re\u2010engineering the way in which business and marketing of their goods and services is being conducted. The approaches to marketing have progressed from productcentered to customer-centered approaches. Marketers are now more than ever before, focusing on customer experience with products and services. According to Kaushik and Rahman (2015) the impact has been mainly profound in the services arena through the development of self-service technologies (SSTs). Past studies on the adoption of technology in different services such as the hospitality sector confirm that a growing number of consumers prefer DIY (Do-It-Yourself) opportunities and in some cases are eager to use SSTs (Jaakkola, Helkkula & Aarikka-Stenroos, 2015). According to Hipps (2016) technology is making it easier than ever to improve diversity levels and reduce discrimination, by providing greater transparency and insight for the service industry. Recently, the mobile service sector has experienced disruptive change caused by smartphones and mobile application (app) services in a short period of time. The numbers of app services have increased explosively with the rise of mobile open markets (Park, 2016). The importance of customer experience is emphasized by Lipkin (2016) who attests that the interest in customer experience (CX) has increased exponentially over the past decades amongst service researchers and practitioners. Customer Satisfaction in Public Services in Kenya According to the Collins English Dictionary, a public service is something such as health care, transport, or the removal of waste which is organized by the government or an official body in order to benefit all the people in a particular society or community. It is something that is done to help people rather than to make a profit. Looked at from another angle, it may be defined as a service rendered in the public interest (Baruch & Holtom, 2011). Public services in Kenya include provision of water and waste water services, roads, infrastructural development, library services, health services, human capacity, conservation and administration. Over the past half-decade, Kenya has emerged, seemingly from nowhere, as a hotbed of innovation in the area of mobile money-transfer systems and for other types of software and services for mobile devices. According to Mengistu and Imende (2013) nearly 70 percent of Kenyan adults transfer money to each other via their mobile phones, the highest percentage of any country on earth, and more than US$320 million dollars are transferred via Kenyan mobile phones each month. Kenya has become host to a flourishing ecosystem where numerous software applications, services and even social habits have emerged from the country\u201fs aptitude, and appetite, for mobile transaction platforms (Mengistu & Imende, 2013). Technological transformation in the business arena is aimed at the customer and ensuring that the customer gets a unique customer experience. LecicCvetkovic, Omerbegovic-Bijelovic,Zaric and Janicic (2016) attest to the fact that internet technologies have completely paved the way to the concept of an electronic economy and that they have enabled the creation of innovative business approaches in the field of sales, production, service delivery and purchases. The public service sector, which has long been labelled as \u201ccustomer averse\u201d must thus tow the line in this era of technological transformation.According to a report on Kenya\u201fs ICT integration into public services (2016), currently service areas on the government side, which have embraced ICT, include the iTax portal, Huduma Centres (under the Ministry of Development and Planning), the Integrated Financial Management Information System and the eCitizen portal. The report further states that \u201cthe rising number of smartphone users will support growth in mobile money usage and cashless payments, especially as the industry looks to provide new value-added services such as consumer payments, cash disbursements and collections in value chains such as agriculture, healthcare, education, power, water and other fast moving consumer good value chains\u201d (Kenya ICT, 2016). The Government of Kenya has outlined a series of programs that are meant to transform key sectors of the economy. Water is defined as an essential resource to support the development activities planned under the Vision 2030.

Our focus is on the technological factors of UI (user interface) on current contracts. We propose a remedy of industry-set and best-practice guidelines under federal supervision, which can help establish enforceable industry standards without chilling innovation. The only way to support a user\u2019s rights to privacy protection and transparency would be to create a set of guidelines and a model UI for usability and clarity that regulate UIs and potential dark patterns to ensure that a user is giving fully-informed consent through the ToS. Our solution is a set of guidelines with a model prototype UI that balances the needs of the major stakeholders: the government, the users, and the companies. Introduction The Google Play store released over 1.25 million apps in 2016, with the iOS App Store close behind, with just over 1 million apps released [1]. It\u2019s no surprise that the average American is agreeing to more Terms of Service (ToS) contracts than everreading through every digital contract that the average user agrees to would take almost 250 hours every year [2]. It should also be no surprise that most, if not all, of these digital contracts go unread. Studies have shown, again and again, that we will blindly agree to relinquish our first-born child[3], to scrape chewing gum off sidewalks [4], and even to give up our immortal soul [5]. The widespread and increasing use of \u201cdark patterns\u201d [6] and other techniques of subtly manipulating consumers into unintentional choices, while purchasing products or agreeing to Terms of Service (ToS) contracts, violates commerce rules of the FTC Act against deceptive marketing. Abuses happen when companies employ dark patterns, or UIs specifically designed to trick users into making choices against their best interests. Dark patterns can influence users by obscuring information, presenting information misleadingly, or simply using subtle cues to bias users towards certain options. With a plethora of dark patterns emerging in the UIs of many ToS contracts that users see today, it becomes increasingly more difficult to avoid getting tricked by unscrupulous companies and websites. While current judicial precedents have deemed regular ToS as enforceable because they are usually both clearly presented and explicitly agreed to by users (Schnabel v. Trilegiant Corp), the government does little to ensure that users are not being manipulated into agreeing by UIs [7]. The OECD recommendations [8], FTC\u2019s privacy notice proposal, Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights [9], and FIPPs, all stress the importance of users not only giving consent but giving unbiased, fully informed consent for their data to be used. The only way to support the user\u2019s rights to privacy protection and transparency would be to bring regulations on ToS into alignment with these directives, namely by regulating UIs and dark patterns to ensure that a user giving consent means that they are giving fully informed consent. The government, the users, and the companies are all major stakeholders in this issue. Of course, it would be exceedingly difficult to develop a strategy that would satisfy all the stakeholders in this issue. Our solution seeks to find the best compromise between these parties by raising awareness for the content and meaning of ToS contracts through creating guidelines for interfaces that are more intuitive and clear to navigate without limiting companies too strictly. After all, Terms of Service contracts are a necessary step for companies to explain their services and for users to understand their rights. Specifically, we propose a set of guidelines for usability and transparency, and we have designed a model UI that reflects these guidelines. We believe that our prototype will protect the users, but at the same time, will not impinge on the ability of companies to innovate, so long as they are not employing any misleading UI designs. The prototype will also make it more straightforward for the government to evaluate ToS contracts and decide whether or not they are constitutional or enforceable. In this paper, we propose a novel design that we have implemented to increase user interaction and comprehension of ToS contracts, which has have the potential to help establish enforceable industry standards without chilling innovation. These standards, moreover, can be aligned with both European OECD standards and US policies laid out by the FTC privacy notice proposal, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, and FIPPS. Finally, we analyze the results of our preliminary user testing and offer suggestions for next steps in the design, as well as future work in this area. Methods Experimental Design In our study, we wanted to compare the effectiveness of communication between our prototype Terms of Service layout (Fig 1) and the standard layout of a Terms of Service contract (Fig 2). With the two Terms of Services compared next to each other by being tested on the same research participants in randomized order, we were able collect both quantitative and qualitative feedback. For the quantitative feedback, we sought to test for the following two specific measures of effective communication: the length of time it took to read through each Terms of Service, and the comprehensibility of the main points communicated in the Terms of Service. We averaged the amount of time it took the research participants to read and complete signing the Terms of Services for the former, and for the latter, we asked research participants specific questions following the completion of the Terms of Service agreement about the big ideas being conveyed. UI Design The new UI was designed based on the two themes mentioned previously. To minimize length, the ToS was compartmentalized into three main sections, each containing 8-12 subsections. Rather than presenting the user with the entire text at once, the first page displayed three red buttons, each representing one of the three main sections: Overview of Services, Disclaimers & Liabilities, and Privacy & Copyright (Fig 1a). After clicking on a section button, the user was taken to the corresponding section page, consisting of 8-12 buttons, each representing the related subsections, as well as an \u201cI commit\u201d button at the bottom of the page (Fig 1b). Hovering over a subsection button would display a \u201cTL;DR\u201d tooltip summarizing the subsection using simple and clear language (Fig 1b). Clicking the subsection button would take the user to the corresponding subsection page, which displayed the actual text of the subsection as found in the ToS (Fig 1c). Once the user was done browsing the subsections they were interested in, they could click the \u201cI commit\u201d button to be taken back to the first page. Interactivity was also built into the UI. As mentioned previously, the three main section buttons were red upon opening the ToS. After entering a section and clicking \u201cI commit\u201d, the user would be returned to the first page, where the button corresponding to the section they had just committed to would turn green. All users quickly realized that they had to view and commit to each main section in order to turn all three buttons green, upon which the \u201cI agree\u201d button would appear at the bottom of the main page (Fig 1d). User Testing Participants (n=26) consisted of college-aged students. For the purpose of an unbiased study, we informed the participants that there were several parts to the study, and that in order to progress onto the main section requiring software engagement, they needed to complete specific actions for the two Terms of Services first in order to provide \u201cinformed consent\u201d. All participants were informed that they would be participating in a study on user interaction with the popular puzzle game \u201cCandy Crush\u201d. In order to reach the game page, participants first had to navigate the ToS interface to give their \u201cinformed consent\u201d to participate in the study. The purpose of this deception was the minimize the risk of any observer effects, ensuring that the participants would not change the way they interacted with the ToS in response to their awareness of being observed. Group A (n=13) were given the modified UI described in the previous section. Group B (n=13) were given a \u201cstandard\u201d UI, consisting of a text box containing the entire ToS (17 pages) with \u201cagree\u201d and \u201cdisagree\u201d buttons at the bottom. Each participant\u2019s screen was recorded via Quicktime for the duration of the study in order to calculate the time they spent on the ToS screen. After they agreed to the ToS and completed the Candy Crush game, participants were given a short quiz on the content of the ToS for a quantitative measure of their understanding. Qualitative questions were also asked regarding the UI they saw, including what they liked and didn\u2019t like, as well as their opinions on what would increase comprehension and readability. Results There was a significant increase in interaction time with the ToS as measured by time spent on the ToS screen for participants receiving the modified UI (Group A). These participants spent an average of 24.38 \u00b1 7.23 seconds on the ToS screen, compared to 2.67 \u00b1 1.76 seconds for those who received the traditional UI (Group B). The keystroke-level model (KLM) was used to estimate the execution time required by each UI. This was a necessary step in order to separate the time participants spent on clicking or moving the mouse from the time they spent actually reading and comprehending the material presented on the page. KLM consists of several operators used to model the actions necessary to complete a task on a computer interface [10]. The estimated time taken to perform each operation is determined from experimental data. To estimate the total ex", "year": 2018}

The amount of time spent on mobile applications has increased tremendously, and as mobile operators are making it easier to use mobile devices when abroad, people can stay connected no matter the time or the place. Not only can the diffusion of mobile technology help to improve the user experience, its application also generates benefits for hotels, in terms of operations as well as finance. Based on these facts, it may be said that the importance of mobile technology and, in turn, mobile applications is huge and meaningful in the context of modern hotel business operations. Mobile technology enables users to access information and applications anytime and anywhere, thus ensuring greater flexibility in communication, cooperation and information sharing. The strategic importance of mobile technology cannot be underestimated, considering that the rapid pace at which mobile technologies are being adopted and improved creates opportunities for new, innovative services that can be provided through mobile devices. \nAs mobile and wireless solutions have become an integral part of everyday life, simplicity, accessibility and easiness-to-use have today transformed mobile technology and mobile applications into an exceptionally important tool for hotel enterprises, helping them to distribute information, simplify processes and enhance productivity and sales in general. Hotel mobile applications on mobile devices like the iPhone, Android and Blackberry can help to increase interaction with end users, share information faster and more efficiently, and ensure guest feedback in real time, Also, the use of mobile applications for mobile devices sends a powerful message to the public that hoteliers are abreast of modern world trends in business and that the services they provide are of high standards and quality. If a hotel enterprise is to perform successfully on the increasingly discerning domestic and foreign tourism market, it needs to direct its attention to new ways of carrying out business processes, promotional activities and sales activities, as well as new ways of communicating with its current and future guests. To a great extent, hoteliers are preoccupied with the problem of how to sell more rooms, more food and beverages, without considering how to make efficient use of marketing channels. Many hotels continue to use out-dated and ineffective marketing channels. Talking about modern hotel business operations, without taking the importance of mobile applications into consideration, is almost inconceivable. \n All enterprises, hotels included, have accepted the fact that, similar to several years ago when they realized that embracing and developing a presence on the Internet was imperative to business operations, it is today essential to integrate the e-business concept throug mobile devices, with mobile applications indisputably being one of the best ways of achieving \nsuch a presence and conducting e-business. Mobile applications provide hoteliers with completely new way on communicating with their guests on an individual level, thus increasing guest satisfaction and loyalty on the one hand and hotel revenue on the other. \n In modern hotel business operations, the presence of mobile applications makes it possible to book accommodations using mobile devices, either through online booking platforms or hotel mobile applications. Accommodation revenue accounts for the largest and most important share of overall revenue of a hotel or hotel chain. In addition to selling accommodation \n capacities via mobile applications, additional sources of revenue can also be found in various offerings and services marketed directly to application users.That guests want top-quality service and experiences is a constant in the hotel industry. Mobile technology, however, has changed the perception of hotel guests and how they experience what is good. To come to closer terms with their present and future guests, hotels need to continuously monitor trends on the ever more discerning and burgeoning tourism market and adapt to the development of new technologies to remain competitive. It is the author\u2019s opinion that hotels in Croatia are insufficiently present on mobile devices through mobile applications. Hence, this study, concerning the meaning and importance of mobile applications in hotel operations, seeks to answer the questions: To what extent are applications present? How are they used? What is their role in modern hotel business \noperations and in the hotel industry in general? With the objective of proving that the proper use of mobile technology via well-designed mobile applications in the hotel industry can, to a considerable extent, facilitate access to target markets, ensure the better dissemination of information and help to improve a hotel\u2019s presentation and sales, the paper presents the results of research conducted showing the extent to which, and the ways in which, mobile applications are used in the Croatian hotel industry. Hence, a model (4M) was prepared and designed for developing multimedia mobile applications for hotel businesses. In addition, the individual elements of mobile applications,with corresponding modules of the proposed 4M model, were systematically analysed as part of the research. Within the research framework, at the very beginning of the research process, the author presents and proposes his own integrated conceptual 4M model for developing hotel mobile applications, with detailed descriptions of and explanations for each module and its associate sub-modules and their elements. The proposed conceptual model comprises nine separate modules, 33 sub-modules and 143 model elements. The name \u201c4M model\u201d stands for Model of MultiMedia Mobile applications for hotel businesses.For the purpose of research in this doctoral dissertation, the categorisation of tourism facilities, hotels, campsites and marinas in Croatia, published on the website of the Ministry of Tourism of the Republic of Croatia (2016), was used as a framework for sample selection. \n Due to issues related to the research subject as well as to the complexity of the task and the desire to draw as accurate as possible conclusions that must be based on qualitative and exact results of the research process, all four-star and five-star hotels in Croatia were included in the research sample. The sample consists of 264 four-star hotels and 35 five-star \n hotels, ranked by county. The hotels selected for the sample account for 45% of all categorised hotels in Croatia. The four-star hotels are distributed across 18 counties, while all five-star hotels are located within only five counties. For the purpose of gathering good-quality and reliable input data needed for empirical research, the responsiveness of the selected hotel websites in the sample was tested using Google\u2019s Mobile-Friendly Test. Research was conducted from March to September 2016. For the purpose of research, data were collected from the websites and mobile applications of all hotels (providing they had the latter) selected for the sample. It was necessary for the author to download all the mobile applications of hotels in Croatia to his mobile device (and to register, if required) in order to analyse all application modules, thus obtaining the most accurate and relevant data for research. Data analysis and processing was carried out by comparing all the modules of hotel mobile applications with the proposed 4M model modules and elements. Data were classified by hotel category and by county. Access could not be gained to the websites of certain hotels, which were therefore not taken into consideration in data analysis and processing. The comparative method and the analysis method were applied to investigate, study, compare and analyse in-depth the existing state of the presence and use of mobile applications in the Croatian hotel industry. The SPSS 23.0 software package for statistical data processing was used to process the data collected. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation) and bivariate statistical analysis (t-test, ANOVA) were used to \n process and analyse data gathered by the comparative method. With the aim of proving the hypotheses formulated, a combination of scientific methods were used in the scientific research and presentation of research results. The scientific research methods applied were determined by the issues, possibilities and circumstances in which research was conducted. The results obtained by empirical research are indicative of hotel facility managers who seek to improve hotel performance by introducing new technologies; they can also be of help to all stakeholders in the hotel industry, in particular to hotels that want to become and remain competitive in the market. Also based on empirical research, proposals, suggestions and incentives are put forward, which could be directly and practically applied in various business processes, in particular in the field of hotel sales and marketing, with emphasis on a two-way communication process between guests and a hotel in real time.", "year": 2017}

We developed the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), a comprehensive system for sharing sleep data. The NSRR embodies elements of a data commons aimed at accelerating research to address critical questions about the impact of sleep disorders on important health outcomes. Approach: We used a metadata-guided approach, with a set of common sleep-specific terms enforcing uniform semantic interpretation of data elements across three main components: (1) annotated datasets; (2) user interfaces for accessing data; and (3) computational tools for the analysis of polysomnography recordings. We incorporated the process for managing dataset-specific data use agreements, evidence of Institutional Review Board review, and the corresponding access control in the NSRR web portal. The metadata-guided approach facilitates structural and semantic interoperability, ultimately leading to enhanced data reusability and scientific rigor. Results: The authors curated and deposited retrospective data from 10 large, NIH-funded sleep cohort studies, including several from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, into the NSRR. The NSRR currently contains data on 26,808 subjects and 31,166 signal files in European Data Format. Launched in April 2014, over 3000 registered users have downloaded over 130 terabytes of data. Conclusions: The NSRR offers a use case and an example for creating a full-fledged data commons. It provides a single point of access to analysis-ready physiological signals from polysomnography obtained from multiple sources, and a wide variety of clinical data to facilitate sleep research. The NIH Data Commons (or Commons) is an ambitious vision for a shared virtual space to allow digital objects to be stored and computed upon by the scientific community. The Commons would allow investigators to find, manage, share, use and reuse data, software, metadata and workflows. It imagines an ecosystem that makes digital objects Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Four components are considered integral parts of the Commons: a computing resource for accessing and processing of digital objects; a \"digital object compliance model\" that describes the properties of digital objects that enable them to be FAIR; datasets that adhere to the digital object compliance model; and software and services to facilitate access to and use of data. This paper describes the contributions of NSRR along several aspects of the Commons vision: metadata for sleep research digital objects; a collection of annotated sleep data sets; and interfaces and tools for accessing and analyzing such data. More importantly, the NSRR provides the design of a functional architecture for implementing a Sleep Data Commons. The NSRR also reveals complexities and challenges involved in making clinical sleep data conform to the FAIR principles. Future directions: Shared resources offered by emerging resources such as cloud instances provide promising platforms for the Data Commons. However, simply expanding storage or adding compute power may not allow us to cope with the rapidly expanding volume and increasing complexity of biomedical data. Concurrent efforts must be spent to address digital object organization challenges. To make our approach future-proof, we need to continue advancing research in data representation and interfaces for human-data interaction. A possible next phase of NSRR is the creation of a universal self-descriptive sequential data format. The idea is to break large, unstructured, sequential data files into minimal, semantically meaningful, fragments. Such fragments can be indexed, assembled, retrieved, rendered, or repackaged on-the-fly, for multitudes of application scenarios. Data points in such a fragment will be locally embedded with relevant metadata labels, governed by terminology and ontology. Potential benefits of such an approach may include precise levels of data access, increased analysis readiness with on-the-fly data conversion, multi-level data discovery and support for effective web-based visualization of contents in large sequential files.", "year": 2018}

Yet, despite the growing number of applications that would benefit from haptic feedback, its penetration rate remains low. We have identified three under-researched features of haptic feedback that we believe are necessary to break the bottleneck: multimodality, thermal feedback and wearability. Indeed, while haptic perception results from the integration of multiple somatosensory inputs, the interactions between haptic modalities have rarely been investigated. Thermal feedback is an ideal candidate to explore these interactions as skin temperature is known to modulate the sensitivity of skin receptors. Finally, although haptic perception is distributed over the entire body, most multimodal haptic devices are still bulky and rigid, thus limiting their usage to specific body parts and applications. As the integration of multiple feedback modalities into a flexible display is complex, the benefits of these three features need to be demonstrated. This motivated the developments presented in this thesis. First, we miniaturized and integrated thermal feedback in multisensory platforms to investigate its role in conveying non-sensory information and modulating tactile perception. The first study showed that users are able to distinguish the temperature difference between two adjacent thermal stimuli presented under the fingertip by a high-density thermal display, highlighting the potential of miniaturized displays to deliver thermally-encoded information through small skin areas. A second study showed that modifying the skin temperature yielded changes in the precision of stiffness judgments up to 22.3%, suggesting that thermal feedback can be used to modulate the perception of complex haptic percepts. Moving towards complete wearability, we introduced a wearable multimodal display that matches the skin curvature to deliver thermo-tactile cues optimally, as supported by the high users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 identification rates of simulated materials. Subsequently, we developed a portable hydraulic actuation that generates multimodal tactile feedback in remote 3D-printed flexible displays, paving the way to truly versatile wearable multimodal displays. Finally, a tactile suit remapping tactile and proprioceptive sensations from the virtual legs of an avatar onto the upper limbs of paraplegic patients is developed. We show that the patients were able to perceive the position of the virtual legs based on tactile feedback alone, that the use of tactile feedback in synchrony with the avatar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk changed the perception of the boundaries of their body, and that the modulation of the tactile stimulation induced a robust sensation of walking on different floors. These results demonstrate the potential of wearable tactile displays to create perceptual orthoses. In this work, we have developed the tools to deliver a multimodal tactile stimulation using wearable thermo-tactile displays and have shown how their unique features can impact fields such as surgical and rehabilitation robotics. These findings encourage the future development of wearable multimodal tactile displays taking advantage of the synergies between haptic modalities to improve teleoperation and sensory rehabilitation.", "year": 2016}

Developers are now producing numerous mobile games with increasingly immersive graphics. However, these resource-hungry applications inevitably keep pushing well beyond the hardware limits of mobile devices. The limitations causes two main challenging issues for mobile game players. First, limited computational capabilities of smart devices are preventing rich multimedia applications from running smoothly. Second, the minuscule touchscreens impede the players from smoothly interacting with devices as they can do with PCs. \u00a0\u00a0This thesis aims to address the two issues. Specifically, we implement two systems, one for the application accelerations via offloading and the other for alternative interaction approach for mobile gaming. We identify and describe the the challenging issues when developing the systems and describe our corresponding solutions.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the first system, it is well recognized the performance of GPUs on mobile devices is the bottleneck of rich multimedia mobile applications such as 3D games and virtual reality. Previous attempts to tackle the issue mainly mirgate GPU computation to servers residing in remote datacenters. However, the costly network delay is especially undesirable for highly-interactive multimedia applications since a crisp response time is critical for user experience. In this thesis, we propose GBooster, a system that accelerates GPU-intensive mobile applications by transparently offloading GPU tasks onto neighboring multimedia devices such as SmartTV and Gaming Consoles. Specifically, GBooster intercepts and redirects system graphics calls by utilizing the Dynamic Linker Hooking technique, which requires no modification of the apps and mobile systems. Besides, GBooster intelligently switches between the low-power Bluetooth and the high-bandwidth WiFi interface to reduce energy consumption of network transmissions. We implemented the GBooster on the Android system and evauluate its performance. The results demonstrate that GBooster can boost applications' frame rates by up to {85\\%}. In terms of power consumption, GBooster can achieve {70\\%} energy saving compared with local execution.\u00a0 \u00a0Second, we investigate the potential of built-in mobile device sensors to provide an alternative interaction approach for mobile gaming. We propose UbiTouch, a novel system that extends smartphones with virtual touchpads on desktops using built-in smartphone sensors. It senses a user's finger movement with a proximity and ambient light sensor whose raw sensory data from underlying hardware are strongly dependent on the finger's locations. UbiTouch maps the raw data into the finger's positions by utilizing Curvilinear Component Analysis and improve tracking accuracy via a particle filter. We have evaluate our system in three scenarios with different lighting conditions by five users. The results show that UbiTouch achieves centimetre-level localization accuracy and poses no significant impact on the battery life. We envisage that UbiTouch could support applications such as text-writing and drawing.", "year": 2016}

Research on pedagogical agents is one of the solutions offered to overcome the challenges. MeMo Tutor, the pedagogical agent in this study, acts as a scaffold using integrated metacognitive and motivational scaffoldings. This study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the MeMo Tutor by measuring the level of user satisfaction when using the application. Measuring usability helps determine how usable (e.g., effective, efficient, easy to learn) the system from users\u2019 perspective, determine whether any issues need to be fixed, and monitor the performance of the system design over time. The usability evaluation process involved thirteen participants in the first iteration and fifty-six participants in the second iteration. Evaluation data were collected and analyzed using an online prototype analytical tool and System Usability Scale (SUS). In the first iteration, the usability score shows that users were often confused by ambiguous words, especially if the words were close together. This study shows that the average usability score of the online prototype analytical tool correlates well with the average SUS score in the second iteration. The usability results obtained were 88 fromthe online prototype analytical tool and 81.16 from SUS. The score indicates that users were satisfied with the MeMo Tutor application. We recommend focusing on developing mobile-based or responsive web interfaces to improve user experience. In addition, it is crucial to analyze the relationship between the learner\u2019s experience and the learning achievement obtained by the user after using the MeMo Tutor.", "year": 2021}

The evolution of the signs recognition techniques is very fast, because computer systems and algorithms implemented in them make decisions autonomously. The advances and progress made in the means of interaction between humans and computers make it possible to create new methods to make easier life for people with this type of difficulties. Recognizing hand gestures is a way to create a useful and highly adaptable interface between machines and users; therefore, the project belongs to the field of Digital Image Processing. The American Sign Language (ASL) recognition presents different difficulties, between them the great variability of human hands gestures in the signs representation of ASL alphabet, being one of the main problems the different traits in the hand, as for example: the skin tone, the fingers size and their position in the gesture. There are several types of systems and methods for sign language recognition. The chosen method for the development of the project is very robust and efficient for the static recognition of hand gesture. The system consists of an algorithm developed in Matlab and based on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform also known as SIFT, because this type of transform obtains the features of an image very efficiently. The main goal of the project is to propose such a system so that it is able to recognize the different static hand gestures of the American Sign Language with the greatest possible success, comparing different types of gesture images as input to the program with other gesture images \nalready existing in a database, after that analyze which gestures are the most complicated to recognize and obtain the success ratios of the system for the different tests that are done.", "year": 2017}

The 5 kHz linerate scanning is more than three orders of magnitude faster than typical AFM instruments. Highprecision electronics and enhanced accuracy of positioning sensors enable closed-loop sample scanning on all three axes. These factors contribute to reduction of drift, enable routine observation of atomic defects, and reach resolution at sub-molecular levels. Surveying molecular events with a temporal resolution of 20 ms is possible with an 8 MHz bandwidth detector. Scan speed limitations were reduced using high-bandwidth processing electronics, a custom high-speed power amplifier, and advanced algorithms for scanner control and feedback loop error correction. Dynamic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control eliminates feedback saturation errors, improves the tip-sample force control, and ensures stable successive imaging on soft and fragile samples. Fully automated alignment and calibration ensure fast cantilever drive and minimal perturbance of delicate samples. Laser excitation in the near-infrared range is optional for photosensitive and thermally unstable samples. Fast electronics and advanced algorithms ensure short feedback response times for the high-resonance 180 kHz z-scanner, typically faster than the cantilever resonance. These technological improvements allow real-time visualization of dynamic processes taking place on the millisecond scale, enabling researchers to gain better understanding of complex biological systems and molecular mechanisms. New workflow-based software, suitable for multi-user environments, produces higher throughput and allows more experiments per day. The multi-level user-friendly interface features optional guidance and context-sensitive onscreen assistance; operators, irrespective of experience level, can focus on performing novel measurements rather than troubleshooting technical challenges. Optional add-ons provide control of temperature, fluidic exchange, and the monitoring of dynamics triggered by chemical alteration, temperature, or light. Applications are predominantly in life sciences, including studies of single molecule binding dynamics, tracking of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, monitoring of enzyme kinetics, and visualization of supramolecular protein structure self-assembly. High-speed force spectroscopy applications include nanomechanical mapping of single molecules, membrane segregation, and studies of novel unfolding pathways of biomolecules. Materials science applications include monitoring of atomic-scale point defects in flat sheet inorganic minerals (calcite, mica), crystallization dynamics of polymer transitions, step-edge kinetics of inorganic crystals, and dynamics of micelle formation.", "year": 2021}

The research presented in this thesis focuses on the design and testing of software created to teach introductory computer science and literacy concepts to postsecondary and adult learners. A study testing the relative effectiveness and subjective user enjoyment of different interfaces for a mobile game is also included in this thesis, as the results of the study led to the primary research objectives investigated in further studies. Our primary research objective was to investigate whether using gamification design approaches to mobile educational software could result in student engagement and learning. Our central hypothesis is that gamification design approaches can be used to create engaging and educationally effective mobile educational software. Our secondary research objective is to determine how mobile educational software can be made more or less engaging and educationally effective through gamification design approaches, by trying different approaches, testing the resulting applications, and reporting the findings. Three studies were conducted based on these objectives, one study to teach various computer science concepts to students in a first year computer science course with iPad applications, and two studies which used iPad applications to teach punctuation and homonyms, and improve reading comprehension. The studies document the design of the applications, and provide analysis and conclusions based on the results of testing. Through the results of these studies we affirm our hypothesis. We make design suggestions for software creators, such as providing corrective feedback to the user. We discuss common themes that emerged across the studies, including how to best use educational software. Finally, as avenues for future work, we suggest investigating the impromptu social effects of using tablet software in a classroom, and the development of a usability testing platform.", "year": 2016}

CRS is an online community dedicated to sharing, rating, and reviewing deals and coupons across a variety of products and services. CRS usually entails the following properties: 1) real-time deals posted by users and editors; 2) user interfaces enabled by social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and WeChat); 3) collaborations among community members and editors enabled by community-based features. Despite the rapid growth of CRS, there is a lack of research about why and how consumers interact with CRS. Careful evaluations of the CRS are critical to ensuring that firms can effectively exploit its potential. This study uses the lens of affordance to examine consumers\u2019 attitudes toward the use of CRS and behavioral intention derived from CRS use. We first conceptualize the concept of affordances of CRS and then examine the relationship between CRS affordances and consumer behavioral intentions. We expand the concept of affordance statics interactions among material agent, human agent and the organization to tap into the hybrid form of social media and shopping websites. A two-phase approach research design will be used for the study. Given the limited literature on CRS, in the first phase, we utilize qualitative methods to gain an exploratory understanding of the key constructs and relationships by conducting semi-structured interviews and collecting user-generated text review data on CRS. As a result of the first phase, a research model will be developed. In the second phase, we utilize quantitative methods to operationalize the various constructs and to test the research model by developing measurement instruments and collecting survey data. We expect to test the mediating effect of CRS affordance between consumers\u2019 demographic differences and purchase intention. We expect to further build a predictive model on the willingness to buy using CRS affordance and relevant variables. The qualitative exploratory study phase will (1) demonstrate different sentiments towards CRS, (2) identify dimensions of affordance associated with CRS such as functional affordance, subjective affordance, and interactive affordance, and (3) reveal the advantages and shortcomings of CRS from the consumers\u2019 perspective. The quantitative model testing study phase will (1) develop and validate the measurement instruments for assessing different dimensions of affordance and the other key constructs in the research model, and (2) provide empirical evidence of the significant role that affordance plays in the interplays among consumers, CRS providers, and product/service providers, and (3) illustrate the mediating effects of CRS affordance on consumers\u2019 purchase intention. This research makes both theoretical and practical contributions. From a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the literature by providing insights into the concept of affordance regarding CRS enabled by hybrid social media and shopping websites, by modeling and testing affordance and shedding lights on its role in influencing consumer behavioral intentions. From a practical perspective understanding of affordance can be applied in interface design, in a better understanding of users\u2019 intention, interpretation, and evaluation of CRS. By demonstrating the effectiveness of understanding CRS perceptions and use through the lens of affordance, this study also provides product and service providers with insights on how to improve their decision-making processes and marketing strategies.", "year": 2017}

However, once collected, these data are difficult for health professionals to access to support clinical decision making and performance review. There is a need for innovative tools that make clinical data more accessible to support health professionals in these activities. One approach for providing health professionals with access to clinical data is to create the infrastructure and interface for a clinical dashboard to make data accessible in a timely and relevant manner.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n This study aimed to develop and evaluate 2 prototype dashboards for displaying data on the identification and management of lymphedema.\n \n \n METHODS\n The study used a co-design framework to develop 2 prototype dashboards for use by health professionals delivering breast cancer care. The key feature of these dashboards was an approach for visualizing lymphedema patient cohort and individual patient data. This project began with 2 focus group sessions conducted with members of a breast cancer multidisciplinary team (n=33) and a breast cancer consumer (n=1) to establish clinically relevant and appropriate data for presentation and the visualization requirements for a dashboard. A series of fortnightly meetings over 6 months with an Advisory Committee (n=10) occurred to inform and refine the development of a static mock-up dashboard. This mock-up was then presented to representatives of the multidisciplinary team (n=3) to get preliminary feedback about the design and use of such dashboards. Feedback from these presentations was reviewed and used to inform the development of the interactive prototypes. A structured evaluation was conducted on the prototypes, using Think Aloud Protocol and semistructured interviews with representatives of the multidisciplinary team (n=5).\n \n \n RESULTS\n Lymphedema was selected as a clinically relevant area for the prototype dashboards. A qualitative evaluation is reported for 5 health professionals. These participants were selected from 3 specialties: surgery (n=1), radiation oncology (n=2), and occupational therapy (n=2). Participants were able to complete the majority of tasks on the dashboard. Semistructured interview themes were categorized into engagement or enthusiasm for the dashboard, user experience, and data quality and completeness.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n Findings from this study constitute the first report of a co-design process for creating a lymphedema dashboard for breast cancer health professionals. Health professionals are interested in the use of data visualization tools to make routinely collected clinical data more accessible. To be used effectively, dashboards need to be reliable and sourced from accurate and comprehensive data sets. While the co-design process used to develop the visualization tool proved effective for designing an individual patient dashboard, the complexity and accessibility of the data required for a cohort dashboard remained a challenge.\n", "year": 2018}

As a representative that involves both kinds, the highly profitable Guaranteed Delivery (GD) advertising focuses mainly on promoting brand effect by allowing advertisers to order target impressions weeksin advance and get allocatedonline at the scheduled time. Such a business mode naturally incurs three issues making existing solutions inferior: 1) Timescale-granularity dilemma of coherently supporting the sales of day-level impressions of the distant future and the corresponding fine-grained allocation in real-time. 2) High dimensionality due to the Cartesian product of user attribute combinations. 3) Stability-plasticity dilemma of instant adaptation to emerging patterns of temporal dependency withoutcatastrophic forgetting of repeated ones facing the non-stationary traffic. To overcome the obstacles, we propose an online temporal hierarchical framework that functions analogously to a CLOCK and hence its name. Long-timescale, coarse-grained temporal data (e.g., the daily impression of one quarter) and short-timescale but fine-grained ones are handled separately by dedicated models, just like the hour/minute/second hands. Each tier in the hierarchy is triggered for forecasting and updating by need at different frequencies, thus saving the maintenance overhead. Furthermore, we devise a reconciliation mechanism to coordinate tiers by aggregating the separately learned local variance and global trends tier by tier. CLOCK solves the dimensionality dilemma by subsuming the autoencoder design to achieve an end-to-end, nonlinear factorization of streaming data into a low-dimension latent space, where a neural predictor produces predictions for the decoder to project them back to the high dimension. Lastly, we regulate the CLOCK's continual refinement by combining the complementary Experience Replay (ER) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques to consolidate and recall previously learned temporal patterns. We conduct extensive evaluations on three public datasets and the real-life user impression log from the Tencent advertising system, and the results demonstrate CLOCK's efficacy.", "year": 2023}

Teleoperation, however, necessitates skilled operators who can handle sophisticated data processing and programming. This research introduces a unique teleoperation method that makes use of Virtual Reality (VR) and the Robot Operating System (ROS) to overcome this problem. By creating a 3D representation of the robot\u2019s workspace in Unity and connecting it to the actual robot with ROS, this technique optimizes control. Programming is not necessary because the robot\u2019s vision serves as the foundation for the user interface. Through ROS integration, a target point is established in Unity and sent to the robot as the end effector position. By simply setting up a new environment, reducing the requirement for knowledgeable operators, and improving situational awareness, this method may be used to any sort of robot. For even greater situational awareness, this technique may also be used with augmented reality (AR). AR can give the operator real-time information about the robot\u2019s surroundings by superimposing digital information over the physical world. This can be achieved by including AR markers in the physical surroundings that the VR system can detect.

How can students learn to do so? How can educators design for learning this? These are fundamental challenges to many forms of education. The challenges are amplified in contemporary society where people traverse many different contexts and where contexts themselves are continuously changing. Designing for Situated Knowledge Transformation provides a structured answer to these questions, through an investigation of the theoretical, empirical, methodological and pedagogical design aspects which they involve. Raising profound questions about the nature of knowledge, of situativity, and of transfer, transformation and resituation, it calls for and provides extended empirical studies of the forms of transformation that knowledge undergoes when people find themselves in new contexts while relying on existing knowledge. Considering many avenues of practical application and insight, Designing for Situated Knowledge Transformation develops a coherent framework for developing learning designs for knowledge transformation that is crucial in today\u2019s educational settings.This creative and original book develops a framework for situated writing as theory and method, and presents a trilogy of untimely academic novellas as exemplars of the uses of situated writing. It is an interand trans-disciplinary book in which a diversity of forms are used to create a set of interwoven novellas, inspired by poststructuralist and postcolonial feminist theory and literary fiction, along with narrative life writing genres such as diaries and letters, memory work, poetic writing, and photography. The book makes use of a politics of location, situated knowledges, diffraction, and intersectionality theories to promote situated writing as a theory and method for exploring the complexity of social life through gender, whiteness, class, and spatial location. It addresses writing as an interand trans-disciplinary form of scholarship in its own right, with emancipatory potential, emphasising the role of writing in shaping creative, critical, and reflexive approaches to research, education, and professional practice. It is useful for researchers, teachers, postgraduate and PhD students in feminist and intersectionality studies, narrative studies, and pursuing interdisciplinary approaches across the humanities, social sciences, design, and the arts to inspire a theory and method for situated writing.

Design involves many participants and encompasses a range of interactions and interdependencies among designers, designs, design methods, and users. Design is also multidisciplinary, extending beyond the traditional design professions into such domains as health, culture, education, and transportation. This book presents eighteen situated design methods, offering cases and analyses of projects that range from designing interactive installations, urban spaces, and environmental systems to understanding customer experiences. Each chapter presents a different method, combining theoretical, methodological, and empirical discussions with accounts of actual experiences. The book describes methods for defining and organizing a design project, organizing collaborative processes, creating aesthetic experiences, and incorporating sustainability into processes and projects. The diverse and multidisciplinary methods presented include a problemand project-based approach to design studies; a \"Wheel of Rituals\" intended to promote creativity; a pragmatist method for situated experience design that derives from empirical studies of film production and performance design; and ways to transfer design methods in a situated manner. The book will be an important resource for researchers, students, and practitioners of interdisciplinary design.Vols. for 1893-1912 contain also \"List of state railroad commissions, showing official titles and addresses, and names and addresses of members and secretaries.\"This book is aimed at researchers and students who would like to engage in and deepen their understanding of design cognition research. The book presents new approaches for analyzing design thinking and proposes methods of measuring design processes. These methods seek to quantify design issues and design processes that are defined based on notions from the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) design ontology and from linkography. A linkograph is a network of linked design moves or segments. FBS ontology concepts have been used in both design theory and design thinking research and have yielded numerous results. Linkography is one of the most influential and elegant design cognition research methods. In this book Kan and Gero provide novel and state-of-the-art methods of analyzing design protocols that offer insights into design cognition by integrating segmentation with linkography by assigning FBS-based codes to design moves or segments and treating links as FBS transformation processes. They propose and test information entropy as a means to capture the information carried by a linkograph and correlate it with the design outcomes.This book encourages further progress in user interface design in practical settings through examination of three themes: user interface projects that have achieved success in real life outside of the research lab; new methods in user interface design and evaluation; and the organizational context in which user interface design is done, and how design might be better accommodated to this context. The product of a workshop sponsored by the Institute of Cognitive Science at the University of Colorado and the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory at the NASA Johnson Space Center, these chapters were contributed by invitation from leading user interface practitioners. They were then reviewed, edited, and organized into three corresponding parts for this book: * Success Cases: describes methods for designing and developing user interfaces for which there is convincing evidence of success. Evidence could include commercial sales, realistic test data, clear statements of user satisfaction, or other information that would be accepted by a prudent judge as indicating that the method actually worked. * Emerging Methods: describes new methods for designing and developing user interfaces that have the potential to significantly improve user interface design and development. * RealWorld Context: discusses how work in user interface design and development accommodates or fails to accommodate real-world organizational, commercial , or practical requirements, and how this accommodation could be improved. An emphasis on practical design issues combined with broad coverage make this an excellent resource for the interface design professional and a useful text for advanced human-computerHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) addresses problems of interaction design: understanding user needs to inform design, delivering novel designs that meet user needs, and evaluating new and existing designs to determine their success in meeting user needs. Qualitative methods have an essential role to play in this enterprise, particularly in understanding user needs and behaviours and evaluating situated use of technology. Qualitative methods allow HCI researchers to ask questions where the answers are more complex and interesting than \"true\" or \"false,\" and may also be unexpected. In this lecture, we draw on the analogy of making a documentary film to discuss important issues in qualitative HCI research: historically, films were presented as finished products, giving the viewer little insight into the production process; more recently, there has been a trend to go behind the scenes to expose some of the painstaking work that wen", "year": 2017}

Most existing click models are based on the examination hypothesis in user behaviors and differ in how to model such an examination bias. However, they are constrained by assuming a simple position-based bias or enforcing a sequential order in user examination behaviors. These assumptions are insufficient to capture complex real-world user behaviors and hardly generalize to modern user interfaces (UI) in web applications (e.g., results shown in a grid view). In this work, we propose a fully data-driven neural model for the examination bias, Cross-Positional Attention (XPA), which is more flexible in fitting complex user behaviors. Our model leverages the attention mechanism to effectively capture cross-positional interactions among displayed items and is applicable to arbitrary UIs. We employ XPA in a novel neural click model that can both predict clicks and estimate relevance. Our experiments on offline synthetic data sets show that XPA is robust among different click generation processes. We further apply XPA to a large-scale real-world recommender system, showing significantly better results than baselines in online A/B experiments that involve millions of users. This validates the necessity to model more complex user behaviors than those proposed in the literature.", "year": 2021}

{"paperId": "7d84e43cf39df4bf85dc4f9a340439f4fb7367ab", "title": "Exploiting Linked Data in Exploratory Search", "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed an explosion in publishing data on the Web, mostly in the form of Linked Data. An important question is how typical users, who mainly use keyword search queries, can access and exploit this constantly increasing body of knowledge. Although existing interaction paradigms in Semantic Search hide their complexity behind easy-to-use interfaces, they have not managed to cover common search needs. At the same time, according to several studies, a large number of search tasks are of exploratory nature. However, in such tasks the traditional \"ranked list\" approach for interacting with the retrieved results is often inadequate. The objective of this thesis is to enable effective exploratory search services which can bridge the gap between the classic responses of non-semantic search systems (e.g., Professional Search Systems, Web Search Engines) and semantic information expressed in the form of Linked Open Data (LOD). Towards this direction, we introduce an approach in which named entities (like names of persons, locations, chemical substances, etc.) are exploited as the glue for automatically connecting documents (search results) with data and knowledge. We study an approach where this entity-based integration is performed at real-time, without any human intervention and without the need of prebuilt indexes. This allows the provision of \"fresh\" information, the easy configuration of this functionality according to the needs of the underlying search application, as well as its easy exploitation by existing search systems. The provision of the aforementioned functionality is challenging. At first, the LOD that are available on the Web are big, are distributed in many knowledge bases, are increased and updated continuously, and also cover many domains. Consequently, there is the need of an interoperability model that will allow the specification of the entities of interest as well as of the related and useful semantic data. In addition, the number of extractable entities from the search results can be very high and the same is true for the amount of semantic information that can be retrieved from the LOD for these entities (i.e., the number of their attributes and of their associations with other entities). Thus, there is also the need of methods that can estimate the important (for the search context) entities, attributes and associations. To cope with the above challenges, this thesis proposes a semantic analysis process in which the search results are connected with data and knowledge at real-time without any human intervention. For describing the entities of interest, as well as the related (and useful for the application context) semantic information, we propose a generic model for configuring a Named Entity Extraction (NEE) system, while for specifying the semantics of this model, we introduce an RDF/S vocabulary, called \"Open NEE Configuration Model\", which allows a NEE system to describe (and publish as LOD) its entity-mining capabilities. To enable associating the result of a NEE process with an applied configuration, we propose an extension of the Open Annotation Data Model which also allows publishing the annotation results as LOD. To examine the feasibility of this model, we developed the system X-Link which, contrary to existing NEE systems, allows its easy configuration by exploiting one or more semantic Knowledge Bases. To identify the important semantic information related to the search results, we introduce and study a ranking method that is based on the Random Walk model and which exploits the extracted entities and their connectivity. The exploitation of the selected semantic information is achieved either through the visualization of the related semantic graph and/or in the context of a faceted interaction model that allows the user to gradually restrict the search space. Besides, this thesis studied the exploitation of such graphs for re-ranking the list of retrieved results aiming to promote relevant but low-ranked hits. The dissertation reports extensive evaluation results of the proposed functionalities and methods. Regarding the system X-Link, a task-based evaluation with users showed its ease of configuration, while a case study illustrated the efficiency of the supported operations. The comparative evaluation of the proposed probabilistic scheme for ranking entities and semantic data showed that the proposed approach is more effective compared to other ranking approaches (producing a more than 20% better ranking). Regarding the presentation of the important entities (and of their associations), the conducted survey in a marine-related search context demonstrated that the majority of participants (more than 70%) prefer to see a graph representation of entities related to the retrieved results regardless of the type of the submitted query. The evaluation of the proposed probabilistic algorithm for re-ranking the retrieved search results (using TREC datasets related to the medical domain) showed that this approach can notably improve the list of results by promoting relevant hits in higher positions. Finally, the implementation and the experimental results of the proposed search process demonstrated its feasibility and efficiency, and also enabled us to reveal its limitations.", "year": 2017}

These developments have disrupted entire industries, including music, travel, accommodation, and financial services, and created new value pools. A great extent of the value creation can be attributed to profit-oriented business models, as shown by the growing valuation of large platform operators (e.g., Airbnb and Uber). At the same time, significant value is unlocked in non-profit oriented business models such as in the context of non-commercial online sharing economy platforms or the digital government space. \nHowever, the online space also brought new challenges to digital platform operators, such as greater rivalry resulting from increasing transparency. As the Internet has largely removed the barriers to information access, website visitors have been enabled to shop around and gather plenty of information before committing to a binding transaction. Therefore, converting visitors to actual customers or users remains a critical task, both for profit-oriented and non-profit oriented digital business model operators, as they need to ensure value is truly captured. \nPrevious research in the Information Systems (IS) space around conversion rate optimization in digital business models has primarily focused on the concept of perceived benefits and associated costs when engaging in a particular transaction. While benefits are often related to the product or service, costs are frequently associated with the lack of trust in the digital platform or website operator due to potential misuse of personal information. In addition to the cost-benefit perspective, website design features have been shown to influence user behavior in both profit-oriented and non-profit oriented digital business models. While the intention of certain design feature elements such as banners or ads is directly visible to users, some design elements are aimed at influencing customer behavior inconspicuously \u2013 without the users' notice. \nThe use of visual user interface elements to subtly influence consumer behavior in digital decision environments by leveraging psychological biases are called digital nudges. The literature on digital nudging shows promising results in driving conversion rates in digital business models. However, the use of digital nudges has been mainly limited to research in profit-oriented digital business models. At the same time, traditional, non-digital nudges have been mainly researched in the non-profit oriented context, especially in the government space, which simultaneously represents the origin of nudging theory. \nBy assessing digital nudges in both non-profit and profit-oriented digital business models, three studies attempt to close this gap. The first study investigates the effect of prosociality nudges on conversion rates on a fictional non-profit oriented online sharing economy platform. Results show that while prosociality increases conversion likelihood, excessive prosociality may also reduce the transaction likelihood. The second study shows how two separately framed communication arguments \u2013 one promotion-focus argument conveying convenience and a prevention-focus argument aiming to reduce privacy concerns \u2013 increase online verification conversion rate in a fictional profit-oriented digital carsharing platform if data supports the claims. While the prevention-focus claim is stronger than the promotion-focus claim if data is added, the prevention-focus claim's conversion rate without data is weaker than no claim. The third study is positioned in the non-profit oriented e-government space, leveraging social proof cues and default options as nudges to increase the adoption rate of electronic identification (eID). Both nudges increase eID adoption, but default options are a double-edged sword. They simultaneously fuel privacy concerns towards the government, which attenuates the effect of the default option on eID adoption. These concerns can be mitigated by adding social proof cues. \nThis thesis contributes to our understanding of how digital nudges may be applied to increase conversion rates within profit-oriented and non-profit oriented digital business models. Specifically, this study demonstrates that digital nudges designed to leverage stability biases and perception biases may be used to increase conversion rates in both profit-oriented and non-profit oriented digital business models. The aforementioned first and third study have contributed to a better understanding of how digital nudges may enhance user conversion in non-profit oriented organizations by leveraging the emotional bias and status quo bias to increase conversion. These studies also provided insights on the combined effect of social proof cues and default options on conversion rates: While default options may be used to increase conversion rates, they are ambidextrous as they increase privacy concerns. However, this can be mitigated by adding social proof cues. The second study contributed to a better understanding of how framing and loss aversion can be leveraged to increase conversion rate in profit-oriented business models. Additionally, this study provided some insights into combining theory on communication arguments with third-party assurance seals as supporting data to enhance the effect of nudges further. From a practical point of view, digital business model operators may leverage these findings to redesign their website by employing digital nudges to drive conversion rates and thus increase profitability.", "year": 2021}

In this paper, we study the POI-based collaboration between apps and venues (e.g., restaurants and cafes). On the one hand, an app charges a venue and tags the venue as a POI, which attracts users to visit the venue and potentially increases the venue's sales. On the other hand, the venue can invest in the app-related infrastructure (e.g., Wi-Fi networks and smartphone chargers), which enhances the users' experience of using the app. However, the existing POI pricing schemes of the apps (e.g., Pokemon Go and Snapchat) cannot incentivize the venue's infrastructure investment, and hence cannot achieve the most effective app-venue collaboration. We model the interactions among an app, a venue, and users by a three-stage Stackelberg game, and design an optimal two-part pricing scheme for the app. This scheme has a charge-with-subsidy structure: the app first charges the venue for becoming a POI, and then subsidizes the venue every time a user interacts with the POI. Compared with the existing pricing schemes, our two-part pricing better incentivizes the venue's investment, attracts more users to interact with the POI, and achieves a much larger app revenue. We analyze the impacts of the app's and venue's characteristics on the app's optimal revenue, and show that the apps with small and large congestion effects should collaborate with opposite types of venues.", "year": 2018}

This detailed investigation delves deeply into the tactics that provide the foundation for improving user interactions within digital platforms. This is an exploration of the dynamic landscape of digital commerce, highlighting the importance of design principles that prioritize user needs, advanced search capabilities, effortless navigation, and tailored customer assistance. The central focus of the paper is the crucial significance of user interfaces that include both intuitive qualities and a high level of responsiveness across diverse devices. The interfaces play a crucial role in fostering user engagement and cultivating consumer loyalty within the digital domain, serving as a fundamental basis for facilitating favorable interactions between businesses and their clients. E-businesses foster an inclusive and user-centric environment by providing mobile-friendly content and interfaces that accommodate a wide range of user requirements. This approach promotes user exploration, engagement, and retention. The subsequent analysis focuses on the development of site search mechanisms, emphasizing the transition from rudimentary keyword searches to sophisticated search algorithms, the introduction of faceted search options, the integration of visual search capabilities, the implementation of predictive search functions, and the increasing significance of voice search. These innovations operate in conjunction to transform the accessibility of items and services, improve the process of making purchases, and enhance overall user involvement. Users are able to easily find desired items, explore other options, and obtain pertinent information, all of which enhance the overall satisfaction and effectiveness of the e-commerce experience. The investigation ultimately penetrates into the realm of virtual assistants and chatbots, which are driven by artificial intelligence (AI). These digital entities provide both immediate assistance and a range of functionalities designed to improve the overall purchasing experience. Customers have the opportunity to get support, monitor their orders, stay informed about product availability, and participate in virtual trials for apparel or furniture, thanks to the implementation of augmented reality and virtual reality advancements. Fundamentally, these diverse techniques highlight the utmost significance of placing user-centricity, innovation in search and navigation, customization, and AI-driven support mechanisms at the forefront in order to provide seamless, captivating, and effective e-business experiences.

Given the growing competition for \u200eusers\u2019 attention and interest, it is agreed that digital content must engage. However, there are no clear methods or \u200eframeworks for evaluation, optimization and creation of such engaging content.\n\nMethodology: Following an interdisciplinary literature review, we recognized three key attributes of words that drive user engagement: (1) Novelty (2) Familiarity (3) Emotionality. Based on these attributes, we developed a model to systematically improve a \u200egiven content using computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis (word frequency, sentiment analysis and lexical substitution).

Chalk porosity reveals to be more complex and heterogeneous than usually assumed. Unexpectedly, spatial variability increases as the observation scale decreases. Pore volumes in outcrop plug samples may vary by 10 % over decimetres although no change in microfacies, grain size or diagenetic overprint is discernible.

Modelling of Modified Salinity Waterflooding: A Comparison between the Mechanistic and Empirical Models Hadise Baghooee, Ali A. Eftekhari, Hamid M. Nick Water flooding is the most widely applied method of improved oil recovery. The majority of the studies show that lowering or modifying the salinity of the injected water seems to alter the wettability towards more water-wet conditions and increases the displacement efficiency of waterflooding. Different mechanistic and empirical models have been suggested to investigate the effect of modified-salinity water flooding on the production history and the ultimate oil recovery. In this study, we model a set of core flooding experiments on the Stevns Klint chalk samples using empirical models and compare the results with an in-house mechanistic model. We first obtain the relative permeability parameters by fitting (history-matching) a two-phase flow model to the reported core flooding recovery data in different formation brine and injection brine compositions. For the empirical group of models, we assume that salt is transported as a pseudo-component in the aqueous phase with/without adsorption on the rock, and we assume that the relative permeabilities are a function of the total salinity. The results show different saturation fronts when the adsorption is included in the model. Experimental Study of the Potential of Dimethyl Ether EOR in North Sea Chalk Reservoirs Hoda Javanmard, Mojtaba Seyyedi, Sian Jones, Sidsel Marie Nielsen The present study aims at quantifying, at the laboratory scale, the potential of Dimethyl Ether (DME) Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) technology to improve oil recovery in North Sea chalk reservoirs. In DME EOR, the DME is dissolved into the brine and injected into the reservoir. The DME is mutually soluble in the water and oil phases with documented strong partitioning into the oil phase. Thus the DME migrates from the water phase to the oil phase, leading to oil swelling and mobilization of residual oil. A series of core flood experiments have been carried out at reservoir conditions on aged core plugs from a North Sea chalk reservoir. The results reveal the significant potential of DME-saturated brine injection in improving oil recovery, with the secondary scenario giving a better performance than the tertiary. The results also show that the saturation condition of DME-brine mixture has a direct impact on the additional oil recovery obtained. Chemistry at the pore \u2013 fluid interface A look into the electrical double layer Nicolas Bovet (University of Copenhagen) The reactivity of pore surfaces is governed by the composition of the pore \u2013 fluid interface. Physical properties such as wettability, surface energy and the ability to adsorb or desorb organic molecules are dependent on nanoscale mechanisms happening at this pore \u2013 fluid interface. We are using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a technique that can \u2018see\u2019 at the nanometer scale, to obtain chemical information about the pore surfaces, thus getting insights on the composition of the few nanometers of fluids in contact with the rocks. In the first Sprint project \u201cSurface Chemistry of Chalk\u201d, we have shown that the surface of chalk from reservoir and chalk from outcrop location do not have the same surface composition. In particular, the amount of organic molecules at the surface is different (Figure 1). This difference should be taken into account when probing the reactivity of the surface, from experiments looking at nanometer scale mechanisms to core plug tests. In our current project \u201cWettability Modification of Chalk\u201d, we plan to match small changes in surface composition to macroscopic measurements of contact angle, a classical measure of wettability. We will exposed calcite and various chalk samples to ions and monitor change in wettability, is order to show that we can predict and therefore screen in the future possible candidates ions for advanced water flooding. 0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 o rg an ic c o n te n t (a rb it ra ry u n it ) Figure 1: organic content of chalk samples Reservoir chalk Outcrop chalk Numerical modelling of two-phase flows in discrete fracture-matrix models Nikolai Andrianov, Hamid M. Nick Centre for Oil and Gas \u2013 DTU The state-of-art numerical models for detailed resolution of fracture-matrix flows are the discrete fracturematrix models (DFM). The DFM models explicitly represent the fracture network as lower-dimensional objects embedded in the matrix grid, and the flow is considered to occur both in the fracture network and in the surrounding rock matrix. Numerical simulation of DFM models is typically faster than a detailed flow simulation, where the fracture is discretized in transversal direction. One of the challenges with DFM models is how to properly account for fracture-matrix interaction. Hydrodynamical and data-driven modelling of unsteady multiphase flows in pipes Nikolai Andrianov Centre for Oil and Gas \u2013 DTU Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing wells and production gathering facilities on the surface. Traditionally, such flows are modelled using hydrodynamical approach, which consists in numerical solution of phase conservation equations. As a result, one can estimate a large number of parameters at arbitrary point of the flow. However, there are serious limitations due to complexity of mathematical models which makes the hydrodynamical models difficult to build and to deploy. An alternative approach is to use a machine learning methodology to estimate key parameters of the flow. We demonstrate how a regression neural network can be used as a virtual flow meter for a synthetic severe slugging case. Poster abstracts from Work Programme Advanced Water Flooding 2 Improved Sweep in Deep Tor Hydraulic Fracturing in Layered Media Saeed Salimzadeh, Teeratorn Kadeethum, Hamid M. Nick Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark Hydraulic fracturing has been proven as an efficient method to improve recovery from unconventional reservoirs and also a potential method for improving the sweep in the North Sea chalk reservoirs. While the majority of the published research focus on a single (or multiple) fracture(s) in a homogenous, single layer rock, it is evident that the real reservoirs are consisted of multiple, soft and stiff layers, which makes the hydraulic fracturing process more complex (Figure 1). When a hydraulic fracture hits an interface, it can be arrested at the interface, or the new layer can act as a favourable medium for the fracture to grow in. In this study, hydraulic fracturing process through multiple layers is investigated using a robust finite element code, CSMP. Different layers in the model have different mechanical properties, thus the stress distribution is not continuous across interfaces and that discontinuity affects the growth direction and the size of the hydraulic fracture in each layer. The hydraulic fractures are assumed to propagate under toughness regime, so the fracture toughness of each layer is also affecting the propagation direction and the shape of the induced fracture.

The program maps a user-defined objective function by varying the operating pressures of the separators of the train. The generated map allows locating optimal operating conditions of the train, as well as evaluating the profit losses due to discrepancies from the optimal conditions. In this work, the objective function accounts for the revenues of the sales of oil and gas and the expenditure for gas re-compression and pumping of cooling water. The test of the program of the present study covers two typical feed compositions (light oil and gas condensate) at two different feed pressures (30 bar and 60 bar) and temperatures (48\u00b0C and 58\u00b0C), for separation trains ranging from 1 to 4 stages.

However, the appeal of this market extends beyond the games themselves, as it offers users immersive experiences not only as players but also as creators and customizers of their in-game characters. This research paper centres around the hypothesis that games have the potential to foster interaction and provide experiences that go beyond their mechanics and design, leveraging the customization options available to players. To explore this concept, an online survey was conducted, supported by a theoretical framework drawing from the fields of design, media, and psychology. The survey aimed to investigate the prevalence of customization practices, examining how players acquire customizations for games and how these personalization enhance their overall gaming experience. The findings underscored the significance of customization as a prominent aspect of gaming and revealed that players derive enjoyment from engaging in this activity, considering it an integral part of their gaming journey. These findings suggest that customization can serve as a valuable tool to enhance players' sense of attachment to the game universe.", "year": 2023}

In vibratory experimentation, one mode of generating vibration is to use electrodynamic exciters. Manual control is a common way of setting the input of the exciter by the operator. To measure the structural responses to these generated vibrations sensors are attached to the structure. These sensors can be deployed by repeatable robots with high endurance, which require on-the-fly control. If the interface between operators and the controls was augmented, then operators can visualize the experiments, exciter levels, and define robot input with a better awareness of the area of interest. Robots can provide better aid to humans if intelligent on-the-fly control of the robot is: (1) quantified and presented to the human; (2) conducted in real-time for human feedback informed by data. Information provided by the new interface would be used to change the control input based on their understanding of real-time parameters. This research proposes using Augmented Reality (AR) applications to provide humans with sensor feedback and control of actuators and robots. This method improves cognition by allowing the operator to maintain awareness of structures while adjusting conditions accordingly with the assistance of the new real-time interface. One interface application is developed to plot sensor data in addition to voltage, frequency, and duration controls for vibration generation. Two more applications are developed under similar framework, one to control the position of a mediating robot and one to control the frequency of the robot movement.

The hypothesis that more life moves online, the less damage to our environment is still unclear. E-commerce sites and the underlying supply chain can have both positive and negative impacts on the environment. Sustainable web design is an approach to designing websites that puts people and the planet first. It is a growing movement as organizations look for opportunities to reduce their influence on the environment. This research elaborates on determinants of consumer behavior that shape online purchase processes and affect the final consumer decision to buy. It discusses the importance of website design on consumer decision-making in e-commerce. Consumer decision-making and behavior during online shopping in the literature are measured by numerous models. One of the primary motivators for any online store to attract customers is the quality of website design. Website quality refers to the overall excellence, effectiveness, and usability of a website. It influences consumers\u2019 perceptions of product quality and affects online purchase intentions (Sun, Chen, and Huang, 2014) and even continuation intentions (Chawla et al., 2015). Website quality as well positively affects online impulse buying behaviour (Akram et.al. 2018). The design of a website interface plays an important role in online purchasing, and customers are more likely to visit and buy from better-designed websites (Chiu and Yang, 2016). This paper proposes that website design quality is a multi-dimensional construct. To support the importance of the construct, a review of different studies is conducted elaborating on the impact of website design on consumer attitude and behavioral intention in North Macedonia. This study has theoretical and practical implications on the existing knowledge and provides managerial insights for e-vendors implying that to promote online shopping, they need to improve the quality features of the website and enhance users\u2019 trust.", "year": 2023}

However, compliance with therapy can be a problem that undermines the prospective advantages of telerehabilitation technologies. Lack of motivation has been identified as a major factor that hampers compliance. Exploring various motivational interventions, the integration of citizen science activities in robotics-based rehabilitation has been shown to increase patients\u2019 motivation to engage in otherwise tedious exercises by tapping into a vast array of intrinsic motivational drivers. Patient engagement can be further enhanced by the incorporation of social interactions.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n Herein, we explored the possibility of bolstering engagement in physical therapy by leveraging cooperation among users in an environmental citizen science project. Specifically, we studied how the integration of cooperation into citizen science influences user engagement, enjoyment, and motor performance. Furthermore, we investigated how the degree of interdependence among users, such that is imposed through independent or joint termination (JT), affects participation in citizen science-based telerehabilitation.\n \n \n METHODS\n We developed a Web-based citizen science platform in which users work in pairs to classify images collected by an aquatic robot in a polluted water canal. The classification was carried out by labeling objects that appear in the images and trashing irrelevant labels. The system was interfaced by a haptic device for fine motor rehabilitation. We recruited 120 healthy volunteers to operate the platform. Of these volunteers, 98 were cooperating in pairs, with 1 user tagging images and the other trashing labels. The other 22 volunteers performed both tasks alone. To vary the degree of interdependence within cooperation, we implemented independent and JTs.\n \n \n RESULTS\n We found that users\u2019 engagement and motor performance are modulated by their assigned task and the degree of interdependence. Motor performance increased when users were subjected to independent termination (P=.02), yet enjoyment decreased when users were subjected to JT (P=.005). A significant interaction between the type of termination and the task was found to influence productivity (P<.001) as well as mean speed, peak speed, and path length of the controller (P=.01, P=.006, and P<.001, respectively).\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n Depending on the type of termination, cooperation was not always positively associated with engagement, enjoyment, and motor performance. Therefore, enhancing user engagement, satisfaction, and motor performance through cooperative citizen science tasks relies on both the degree of interdependence among users and the perceived nature of the task. Cooperative citizen science may enhance motivation in robotics-based telerehabilitation, if designed attentively.\n", "year": 2018}

Although it can be a life-saving procedure, it is also associated with high risks (Nuttall, Stubbs, & Oliver, 2014). Errors or undetected reactions may impose serious health problems or even lead to patient death. Although the process is already heavily supported by a comprehensive barcode-based tracking and verification system to promote safety (Sellen, Jovanovic, Perrier, & Chignell, 2015), adverse events still occurred in several areas across the organization which triggered an in-depth systems analysis of the workflows. We performed our study in three steps: first, we conducted an in-depth analysis using data triangulation (review of relevant documents and metrics, 20 simulations and cognitive walkthroughs in 11 care units, 50 interviews in total, patient observations); second, we synthesized our data by creating process maps and by coding the data; and third, we validated our findings by expert review (clinicians and other stakeholders). To describe the complex workflows, we described the process on three granular levels: 1) Five Generic Tasks (Ordering, Preparation, Transfusion, Post-Transfusion, Documentation). 2) 10 Process Maps (Ordering, Preparing Products, Preparing Patient, Blood Product Release, Routine/Emergency Transfusion, Massive Transfusion, Post-Transfusion (Patient), PostTransfusion (Blood Product), Documentation (Patient), Documentation (Blood Product) describing 81 subtasks and 57 decisions. 3) 29 collections of Epic screenshots to describe the human-computer interaction with the barcoding technology and the electronic medical record in five areas, i.e., ED, OR, Cath Lab, Medicine, Surgery. Through our frontline engagement, we identified 25 tasks with potential for deviations. The deviations are mainly results of poorly designed systems or resource constraints and some of them pose risk for harm or for patients receiving blood or blood components without documented consent. Based on our interviews and walkthroughs, we created a list of 132 data points that are describing the issues in more detail that are relevant to safety and/or performance. We coded the data points by unit (e.g., ED, OR, Cath Lab), task (e.g., Ordering, Preparation: Type and Screen, Transfusion: Verification process,) and by issue type (e.g., EMR usability, cognitive error, lack of trust in technology). Based on the issue type, we also categorized them by system element (e.g., technology, organization, provider). A descriptive analysis of the distribution showed that most issues were related to technology. We also coded the usability issues related to the barcoding technology and EMR by utilizing the ISO 9241-110 Dialogue principles. A descriptive analysis revealed that the top three issues were a lack of conformity with user expectations, a lack of suitability of the task, and a lack of controllability. Based on the analysis, solutions were identified (e.g., redesign of EMR interfaces such as ordering sets or flowsheets) that better support staff to provide safer care to patients. Our analysis and synthesis of the results demonstrate how to describe a complex system on three granular levels using the example of blood product administration. Our study also demonstrates effective transdisciplinary collaboration and supporting tools used to establish a shared understanding of the system across the organization.", "year": 2017}

However, it is not legal to operate touchscreen devices while driving in most of modern countries. On the other hand, a driver may occasionally control in-vehicle systems through touch or even gestural operations on the touch display. The situation is becoming more and more popular and worthwhile further study. The current study investigated three different installations of a multi-touch screen in vehicle at high (around the driver's eye height in sitting), middle (around the height of the driver's shoulder) and low (around the height of the driver's waist) positions. Twenty-seven voluntary participants (aged 23.93\u00b10.68 years old) were recruited to perform single-touch and gestural operations in a simulated car cabin. Their performance in accuracy for the two experimental tasks and subjective responses regarding difficulty, fatigue and preferences of the task and interfaces were recorded. The results of the study showed that, regardless of the single-touch target clicking task or the multitouch target fitting task, the averaged errors over all target positions were the least for the middle installation and were the highest for the low installation. When user performance for different target sizes was compared in the gestural operations, participants tended to deviate more when the target size was small (100-pixel diameter) but manipulated the size more accurately when it was big (200-pixel diameter). The subjective evaluation through questionnaires showed that participants preferred the middle installation. The high installation was considered more difficult and caused greater fatigue on right neck, shoulder, upper extremities, wrist, and thumb belly areas. Based on the results of the current study, the middle installation is recommended for its higher accuracy and less fatigue. The upper installation, despite being recommended by other literature, caused greater errors, higher difficulty and fatigue, resulting the least preference. The difficulty and fatigue was not revealed for the lower installation, but it caused lower accuracy in gestural operations. This study could contribute to future design of in-vehicle touch interfaces in that the accuracy of single-touch and multi-touch tasks may be improved by installing the touchscreen at a middle height (around shoulder level). Future studies may consider verifying experiments in an interface simulating real in-vehicle information systems and increasing the number of data collected so that the result can be more applicable in reality.", "year": 2017}

In the process of designing the ResNet-Mediapipe workflow, we improve the ResNet-50 and integrate it with Mediapipe to improve recognition speed and accuracy. Besides, we also create a brand-new gesture dataset with more than 5700 pictures, which is richer than other open-source gesture datasets. Experiments show that ResNet-Mediapipe can capture hand position in a variety of situations and recognize gestures in real-time with an accuracy rate of over 98.5% and recognition speed up to 45 fps, which is more accurate and faster than other gesture recognition methods. The new gesture-controlled IoT system we propose is equipped with hardware that includes Raspberry Pi, STM32F103, ESP8266, EG200U, and various IoT devices. This system can realize gesture recognition based on ResNet-Mediapipe and control numerous IoT devices. Besides, we design a human-computer interface for the system on the Ali IoT cloud platform and a set of gestures used for human-computer interaction, which enable the users to monitor IoT devices' information on the Web page and choose different IoT devices to control.

Even simple exercises can improve the understanding of the underlying subject. Most experimental setups require special hardware. To carry out e. g. a lens experiments the students need access to an optical bench, various lenses, light sources, apertures and a screen. In our previous publication we demonstrated the use of augmented reality visualization techniques in order to let the students prepare with a simulated experimental setup. Within the context of our intended blended learning concept we want to utilize augmented or virtual reality techniques for stationary laboratory exercises. Unlike applications running on mobile devices, stationary setups can be extended more easily with additional interfaces and thus allow for more complex interactions and simulations in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The most significant difference is the possibility to allow interactions beyond touching a screen. The LEAP Motion controller is a small inexpensive device that allows for the tracking of the user\u2019s hands and fingers in three dimensions. It is conceivable to allow the user to interact with the simulation\u2019s virtual elements by the user\u2019s very hand position, movement and gesture. In this paper we evaluate possible applications of the LEAP Motion controller for simulated experiments in augmented and virtual reality. We pay particular attention to the devices strengths and weaknesses and want to point out useful and less useful application scenarios.", "year": 2016}

They have been studied in various domains, both by the designing and piloting of innovative applications, as well as by comparatively analyzing TUI against GUI interaction. In the human-robot interaction (HRI) field, TUIs are considered a promising approach as they make effective use of physical object affordances, but research is rather inconclusive about whether TUIs offer improved efficiency, lower error rates, increased intuitiveness, engagement, and user satisfaction. In this study, two prototype UIs were designed and evaluated to compare a TUI with a 2D mouse-based UI for remotely operating two agricultural robots used for vineyard spraying. Two different user groups played the role of the operator: computer experts and farmers leading to an experiment with a 2\u00d72 setup, where two different types of UIs were evaluated by two different user groups. The formulated research questions concern the efficiency, accuracy, and user evaluation for each UI and for each group individually and combined. Analysis has shown that there were no statistically significant differences comparing the alternative UIs for each group in terms of time to complete the task, even though computers experts were faster, as expected. Also, the number of collisions, as well as the percentage of unsprayed and double sprayed area, revealed no significant differences, either for user groups or UIs. The TUI received more positive evaluations in terms of user preference, and users reported lower perceived error rates, especially in the case of farmers, who were also more willing to use the TUI in their daily job.", "year": 2022}

Conducted in 2019, the study involved eleven participants in two groups \u2013 six laptop users and five mobile users. Each participant observation focused on six tasks: navigating to the site, finding a liaison librarian, determining if the library had a particular database, locating information on borrowing privileges, finding if a study room was available, and locating a particular special collection. The results revealed that laptop and mobile users browse the site differently though they were equally successful in completing the tasks. The study exposed opportunities to correct a few minor design concerns, address a programming flaw with the mobile menu, and to identify an issue when searching the special digital collections. Usability Study of the Coates Library Website 3 Usability Study of the Coates Library Website after Redevelopment Using Laptop and Mobile Devices Introduction The Coates Library at Trinity University conducted its last usability study over a decade ago in 2007 (Harris, 2008). Though web development has changed over the past twelve years, many of the basic library needs have not. Finding librarians and staff members, locating online databases and journals, and understanding the fundamentals of the library such as hours of operation and loan periods are still relevant today. The 2007 study was used as a springboard for this study. During the website redevelopment process in the spring of 2018, the plan was to conduct a usability study on the beta site before the unveiling, but because of time constraints and issues with the server setup, the study was postponed until after the launch of the site. The strategies used to create the new site included inventorying the existing content and site, reviewing user statistics via Google Analytics, and using web design best practices such as minimizing friction for the user, unifying the site with a common theme, and designing for any device (Cao, 2015). One-on-one meetings with librarians and staff were conducted over the course of several months, and other academic library sites that had been recently redeveloped, such as the Sheridan Libraries at Johns Hopkins and Stanford Libraries, were used as models. The following goals were identified and used to structure the site: \u2022 Facilitate easier access to online databases, guides, books, course reserves, etc. \u2022 Minimize friction by making it easier to view and access some of the library's most used features (ILL, study rooms, liaison librarians, digital commons, etc.) Usability Study of the Coates Library Website 4 \u2022 Create visual identification of librarians with easier access to directory information \u2022 Identify, remove, move and rework awkwardly placed or outdated materials \u2022 Create a FAQs area that is easier to identify and access \u2022 Design a consistent user experience among online sites and tools \u2022 Communicate events, news and general information more effectively \u2022 Highlight the library's special collections \u2022 Create areas for students and faculty where links to the most important library items for each group are in one place \u2022 Design a responsive site that is mobile friendly In the spring of 2018, approximately 86 percent of the library's users were browsing the site via a desktop or laptop computer (Google, Inc., 2019). According to Google Analytics only about 12 percent of the site's users were accessing the site with a mobile device. Even though mobile access accounted for a small percentage of the library's overall usage, the trend toward mobile-only usage continues to rise. In 2018, 52.2 percent of website traffic worldwide was mobile with mobile usage increasing year over year for the past decade (We Are Social, n.d.). Building a sustainable, relevant library website requires a focus on mobile usability in addition to traditional desktop-style access. Purpose One of the many goals of the Coates Library is as follows (Coates Library, 2018): The library will support the teaching and learning and research mission of the university by engaging students and faculty via point-of-need services, by building ongoing relationships that facilitate communication and understanding of patron Usability Study of the Coates Library Website 5 needs, and by providing user-friendly online interfaces for unmediated interaction with library resources. The site serves many stakeholders including students, faculty, staff, administrators, community members, other academic libraries, and the librarians and library staff, and though it is important to meet the needs and expectations of all users, Trinity's students are the foundation of the library's mission and goals. Assessing how students interact with the new site, and how they access resources and services using different devices is an important step in making sure that the site is not only meeting the goals set during redevelopment, but also aligning with the library's overall goals. The main purpose of the study was to determine if students were able to access a variety of basic library resources and services on the new library site without difficulty using either a mobile or laptop device. Method Sample Size After reviewing Coates Library's previous usability study from 2007 and the usability research of Jakob Nielsen, it was determined that two small groups of students \u2013 one for mobile testing and one for laptop testing \u2013 would be appropriate. Jakob Nielsen concluded, \"the best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford\" (Nielsen, 2000). The goal was to recruit at least five students for each of the two usability studies. If more students volunteered, it was determined that they be included in the study as well. Usability Study of the Coates Library Website 6 Recruitment Volunteers were recruited from seven of the Computer Science department's Essential Information Technology classes. Students were asked to reach out via email if they were interested in participating. Once identified, students were sent an email with available appointment slots via Google Calendar. Appointment slots were available at a variety of times in the morning and afternoon over a two-week period. Students were directed to sign up for a 30minute slot that worked with their schedule. Eleven students completed the study, with six using laptops and five using a mobile device. Equipment and Data Collection Students were assigned to either a mobile device (Android Moto E4 Phone) or a laptop computer (Dell Precision 5530) and used Google Chrome to navigate the site. Devices were provided for students during the study to maintain consistency and to minimize setup time. Students were assigned to the mobile or laptop study when they arrived for their scheduled appointments. The study was conducted in a small conference room in the library which houses a big screen TV with an HDMI cable. An HDMI converter was purchased to connect the phone to the TV. The laptop was already equipped with an HDMI plug. Depending on the study, the mobile or laptop device was connected to the TV so that the observer could easily view what the volunteer was doing. Students were timed during each task and notes were taken while students completed the tasks. Because of the small sample size, a database was not used, but notes were later transferred to Excel for time averaging and a Word document for analysis. Usability Study of the Coates Library Website 7 Questions Students were asked to perform a series of tasks navigating the library's website. The study began by asking each student to navigate to the library's main page starting from the Google home page in an open Chrome browser. Students were asked to perform a task and then return to the library's home page. Questions were read twice before students attempted the task. Students were allowed to ask for clarification or to have the task repeated. Students were instructed to keep trying until successful or until time was called. Time was called for all tasks at three minutes. After reviewing the Coates Library's 2007 Usability Study, several tasks and questions were considered relevant and used for this study. These questions are denoted with asterisks in the list below (Harris, 2008). Tasks \u2022 Navigate to the library\u2019s website \u2022 Find the librarian whose liaison area is biology * \u2022 Find if the library has access to the database Films on Demand \u2022 Find information on the library\u2019s loan periods and overdue policies for students * \u2022 Check to see if study room 211 is available at 3pm today \u2022 Find the online digital special collection: Ziperman Postcard collection Follow-Up Questions \u2022 What do you think are the strongest or best characteristics of the library website? * \u2022 How helpful is the design of the library website? * Usability Study of the Coates Library Website 8 \u2022 Can you briefly describe any problems that you've had in the past when using the library website? * \u2022 Do you have any thoughts or observations related to this usability exercise? * Results Population Overview The majority of the students who participated in the study identified as freshman, with a graduation year of 2022 (n=9).

Design exclusion, coupled with limited research in understanding the usability of VR/AR systems for individuals of various (dis)abilities, is detrimental to the goal of providing an enriching and inclusive experience for all users. Furthermore, the designing of optimal 3D user interfaces (UIs) is prone to noisy behaviour from users and variability between user preferences, which makes this process non-trivial. This dissertation provides three central contributions to address this challenge. First, we systematically investigate the design parameters that dominate user performance and comfort when interacting with UI layouts using techniques borrowed from design engineering. Second, we create a novel model-based design toolkit that facilitates the design, creation, and exploration of inclusively immersive 3D UI layouts. This toolkit can be used to construct UI layouts that accommodate the unique perceptual, cognitive, and physical capabilities of the user. We successfully use the design parameter analyses to convert the parameters into predictive models, which are then used to construct a single objective function to optimise. Additionally, we apply a user-in-the-loop approach to our toolkit through preference learning to integrate the designer\u2019s feedback into the optimisation process and suggest alternative configurations pertaining to user capability at design time. Third, we demonstrate a method of evaluating the usability of the toolkit by constructing several design tasks and specifying criteria relating to the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations. The author and another expert evaluator complete these tasks to evaluate the toolkit and provide qualitative feedback and potential extensions to the project. Our UI design toolkit differs from current state-of-the-art techniques for several different reasons: while previous works have integrated specific types of human performance models (such as those related to visual aesthetics or physical ergonomics) into toolkits, our toolkit is the first to combine models related to physical ergonomics, cognition, and visual perception into a single product. Furthermore, the toolkit utilises both multi-objective optimisation and preference learning to provide the designer with the ability to directly influence the optimisation process and steer the direction between exploration and exploitation.

However, the results of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Subterranean (SubT) Challenge revealed that despite various techniques for robot autonomy, human input is still required in some complex situations. Moreover, heterogeneous multirobot teams are often necessary. To manage these teams, effective user interfaces to support humans are required. Accordingly, we present a framework that enables intuitive oversight of a robot team through immersive virtual reality (VR) visualizations. The framework simplifies the management of complex navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO) tasks, such as search-and-rescue tasks. Specifically, the framework integrates a simulation of the environment with robot sensor data in VR to facilitate operator navigation, enhance robot positioning, and greatly improve operator situational awareness. The framework can also boost mission efficiency by seamlessly incorporating autonomous navigation algorithms, including NAMO algorithms, to reduce detours and operator workload. The framework is effective for operating in both simulated and real scenarios and is thus ideal for training or evaluating autonomous navigation algorithms. To validate the framework, we conducted user studies ($N = 53$) on the basis of the DARPA SubT Challenge's search-and-rescue missions.", "year": 2024}

EV Explorer allows users to compare fuel costs for different vehicles based on their own commuting patterns, charging opportunities, vehicle mileage, and local fuel prices. All these inputs can be adjusted by the user for a tailored estimate of annual fuel costs for up to four user-selected vehicles at a time. Default vehicle comparisons promote consideration of plug-in hybrid electric and fully electric vehicles (PEVs). We evaluated EV Explorer through online experimentation, gauging users\u2019 perceptions\u2014before and after using the website\u2014of their current fuel costs, potential savings with PEVs, attitude toward PEV charging, and intention to buy or lease a PEV in the future. Statistically significant changes in each of these variables validate EV Explorer as an educational tool and a persuasive eco-feedback intervention to promote the adoption of PEVs. EV EXPLORER EV Explorer [7] is an online vehicle informational tool that allows users to explore fuel costs and charging requirements for different vehicles tailored to their particular commute patterns. EV Explorer has had over 19,000 users and been promoted and utilized by government, industry, and various media outlets. Website Development EV Explorer is written entirely in JavaScript. It uses Node.js [6] to power its webserver and API. It also makes use of several freely available public APIs. The map-driven content is powered by Google Maps [5]. This includes geocoding and route generation in addition to the standard map display. Vehicle information concerning fuel economy and range comes from an API available from the United States (US) Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [9]. EV Explorer provides relevant fuel prices to the user by combining data from the US Energy Information Administration [1] with the user's location from freegeoip [2] based on their IP address. Electricity price was not created dynamically; it was set at $0.14 USD/kWh, which was slightly higher than average electricity price in the US in 2015. Because EV Explorer is a JavaScript based tool, all of the calculations are done right in the user's browser, which makes the tool very responsive to use. User Interface Flow and Features Upon first entering the site, EV Explorer prompts the user through two steps. \u2018Step 1\u2019 is to enter a home address by either typing it in or dragging a marker to the location on the map in the background (Figure 1). \u2018Step 2\u2019 is to enter a commuting destination in the same way. Upon completion of these two steps, a stacked bar chart comparison of annual energy costs for four vehicles is presented: one gas only, one plug-in hybrid electric, and two fully electric vehicles (Figure 2). The user can explore other features, such as changing the frequency of the commute (default is 5 days per week) and charging opportunities at destination (Figure 3). \u2018Car Manager\u2019 allows the user to select up to four different cars to compare, and allows modification of mileage, range, and time to charge (Figure 4). Another feature allows the modification of gas and electricity prices (Figure 5). Present Research EV Explorer can be considered a type of eco-feedback, defined by Froelich, Findlater, and Landay [3] as feedback on individual or group behaviors with a goal of reducing environmental impact. Though EV Explorer does not explicitly attempt to persuade users to adopt plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) or fully electric vehicles (EVs)\u2014 together referred to as PEVs, the focus on fueling costs and default car comparison that juxtaposes a gas vehicle with three PEVs serve to highlight a major benefit of PEVs, fueling costs. Other vehicle attributes consumers may value, such as aesthetics, performance, utility, safety, and purchase or lease price, are not addressed in EV Explorer. Gardner and Stern [4] made a useful distinction between two types of energy-saving actions: curtailment (habitual low cost behaviors) and efficiency (investments in equipment or structural modifications). While most eco-feedback targets curtailment behaviors [3], EV Explorer targets an efficiency behavior: adoption of a fuel-efficient vehicle. Froelich et al. [3] suggest the importance of addressing efficiency behaviors in eco-feedback since the savings associated with efficiency behaviors is typically much higher than that associated with curtailment behaviors. The present study evaluates EV Explorer as a form of eco-feedback targeting efficiency behavior by measuring its effect on users\u2019 knowledge of, attitudes toward, and intention to adopt PEVs. Froelich et al. [3] note that most evaluative research on ecofeedback in the field of HCI is qualitative and informal, with small sample sizes, focusing on usability and user experience. Few HCI eco-feedback studies have employed field tests, with large sample sizes, experimental designs, and a focus on behavior change. The present study describes a low resource large-scale experimental field research methodology that HCI researchers can easily adopt into their eco-feedback evaluation procedures. Figure 1.

Gas and electricity prices. METHODOLOGY An experimental survey instrument was developed using SurveyMonkey. Users were asked a series of identical questions before and after receiving a link and prompt to visit EV Explorer. This design provided a direct measurement of change in knowledge of, attitudes toward, and intention to adopt PEVs before and after experiencing the website. The before-and-after questions were as follows: \uf0b7 About how much money do you spend on gas and/or electricity to fuel your vehicle(s)? Please enter both a dollar amount and unit of time (e.g., $100/week). \uf0b7 Given your driving patterns, how much would/do you save in fueling costs by driving the following vehicle types compared to a gas only vehicle? (hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric, electric) \uf0b7 Given your driving patterns, how (in)convenient are the charging requirements of the following vehicle types compared to fueling a gas only vehicle? (plug-in hybrid electric, electric) \uf0b7 How likely are you to buy/lease the following vehicle types in the future? (gas only, hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric, electric) In order to identify intervening variables that help explain any observed changes in the dependent variables described above, users were asked which website features they used and what calculations they made while exploring the site (i.e., how much they would spend or save by driving their current vehicle or a different vehicle), as well as demographic questions (age, sex, income, education, and political ideology). Questions were developed using Roger\u2019s [8] diffusion of innovations as a theoretical framework. Rogers describes an innovation-decision process by which an individual decides to adopt, reject, continue, or discontinue an innovative technology. This process consists of five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation.", "year": 2016}

This is achieved by creating scenarios that have set learning objectives to improve clinical practice within multidisciplinary teams and patient safety. Additionally, a robust scenario leads to stimulating and open debriefings [2]. Whilst a paper-based scenario will do this, the aim is to highlight the benefits of using a digital platform for both creating and updating scenarios.\n Paper scenarios have been used for many years to achieve the goals highlighted above but it became increasingly obvious that the resources needed to review, critique, and update those scenarios were no longer effective. This situation was emphasised due to the need to have multiple copies of scenarios across many sites. In order to maintain a quality service, whilst still being able to maintain resources to redevelop and enhance existing scenarios, we implemented a digital authoring platform called IRIS.\n Scenarios were transferred and created allowing a centrally controlled catalogue that could be audited and version controlled. Any changes made would automatically update the scenario on all the users\u2019 tablets thus ensuring the same version of the scenario was used across all sites. An immediate benefit was the reduction in time spent redeveloping scenarios. This allowed for added details to be entered dependent on if it was a standardised patient or manikin driven scenario. Another benefit was the ability to rapidly collaborate and co-author with peers and subject matter experts. IRIS interfaces with manikins from leading vendors, sending patient data states directly to the manikins reducing setup time. We noticed an increase in simulation engagement as authors were able to log on remotely to update work.\n IRIS allows easy design and supports the development of high-quality scenarios. Its implementation saved resources in terms of time, staffing and environmental footprint. It enabled us to have a central hub of scenarios that dismissed the need to do multiple updates in multiple places and enabled us to have an audit trail of changes, by date time and user. Moving to a digital platform enhanced the experience of our users giving them a better learning experience leading to improved patient care.\n 1. Alinier G.

One more issue is a structural organization of physiological systems, which typically reveals complex systematics at various levels (Tawhai, & Bates, 2011).

For example, a central nervous system and cardiological signals can control it internally, whereas the external inputs of air pollutants can bring to the immuno-reactions triggering a pathological behavior in a shortor long-term horizon (Frey et al., 2005, 2011; Pearce & Merletti, 2006). The question for engineer and scientists engaged in biomedical aspects of metrology is how to disentangle the information contained in complex and varying sets of physiological data. Operation with experimental data assumes not only defining the newer and newer construction of abstract measures quantifying the complex processes, but also their application to real data of various lengths. Insufficient progression in development of algorithms adapted to working with long sets of data is one of the causes which slow down the work devoted to designing of the optimal measurement protocol for respiratory diagnostics. Advances in the field of complex biomedical signal analysis have also been limited by lack of concentrated and concerted research efforts (Goldberger et al., 2000). Furthermore, advanced analytic techniques developed by experts in the field are often not readily accessible to end users (e.g., clinicists), who may lack the background and technical skills needed for the successful use of these new tools. The paper deals with the issue of respiratory measurements by characterization of complexity and variability of outputs with the use of authorial software library. Universal use of the tool enables monitoring and systematization of a broad range of respiratory pathologies, e.g., asthma, cystic fibrosis, sleep apnea syndrome, and the procedures can be also applied for the other biomedical or technical tasks. 2. SOFTWARE LIBRARY FOR COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS A. Initial Preprocessing of Data Working with long sets of data can be ineffective and requires allocation of important memory resources in a computational unit. Additionally, very often it is a need for transformation of the whole string of data or its parts. To facilitate the task of initial preprocessing of data to complexity and fluctuation analysis, a dedicated application with a graphical interface was designed in Matlab. Its main tasks are: \u2022 Loading the data from ASCII file containing the one-column data format or multi-column record of polisomnography (application identifies the channel for a built-in data format and a given device), \u2022 Viewing the analyzed time series (in a whole range or zoomed), \u2022 Windowing the data for further processing (the number of first sample and the whole number of samples in the window can be chosen optionally), \u2022 Enabling access to numerous procedures of initial data preprocessing (e.g., filtering, extracting the special features of time series, etc.), \u2022 Writing the transformed data to the file(es), also in the mode of multi-window division of data (windows can overlaps each other with the defined number of samples). 24 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the \"Add to Cart\" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/software-tool-assessmentcomplexity-variability/58069?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Engineering, Natural, and Physical Science, InfoSci-Knowledge Discovery, Information Management, and Storage eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Engineering eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Select.

This leads agile teams to miss the mark with their products because they neglect or mischaracterize the target users\u2019 needs and environment. While the reported examples focus on software, the lessons apply equally well to the development of services or tangible products. 1. Why it matters to the ACM community Over the past 15 years, agile and lean product development practices have increasingly become the norm in the IT industry [3]. At the same time, two synergistic trends have also emerged. 1. End users\u2019 demand for good user experience has increased significantly, with wide adoption of consumer electronics products. Any new application needs to do something useful or fun, plus it needs to do it well and fast enough. In 2013, technology analysts found that only 16% of people tried a new mobile app more than twice, suggesting that users have low tolerance for poor user experience (UX) (where UX is the totality of user's interactions supported by the app to accomplish a goal) [9]. 2. With growing emphasis on good UX design, UX professionals, both designers and researchers, are gradually being incorporated as required roles in software development, alongside product managers and software developers. A 2014 Forrester survey of 112 companies found that organizations in which there was systematic investment in UX design process and user research self-evaluated as having greater impact than those with more limited scope of investment [1]. These trends describe a new context that often finds agile teams unprepared for two main reasons. First, while the agile process formally values the principle of collaboration with customers to define the product vision, we and our colleagues in industry too often observe this principle not being put into practice: teams do not validate requirements systematically in the settings of use. Second, even when customers are involved, sometimes the teams may still fail to involve actual end users. As Rosenberg puts it, when user requirements are not validated but are still called \u201cuser stories\u201d, this creates \u201cthe illusion of user requirements\u201d that fools the team and the executives, who are then mystified when the product fails in the marketplace [10]. Below we illustrate five classic examples of failures to involve the actual end users or to gather sufficiently comprehensive data to represent their needs. Then we propose how these failures can be avoided. Published on Communications of the ACM, September 2017: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126156 Figure 1. An engineer recommends user research (a licensed Dilbert cartoon) 2. Cases of neglect or mischaracterizations of the user We identified five classic cases of failures to involve the actual end users. 2.1 The wild west case The first and most obvious case occurs when the team does not do regular testing with the users along the development process. Thus the team fails to evaluate how well the software built fits target users, their tasks, and their environments. A real-life example of this failure is the development and deployment of Healthcare.org, where the team, admittedly, did not fully test the online health insurance marketplace until two weeks before it opened to the public on October 1, 2013. Then the site ran into major failures [8]. 2.2 Chooser \u2260 target user The second case is neither new nor unique to agile. The term \u201ccustomer\u201d conflates the chooser with the user. Let\u2019s unpack these words: \u25cf A customer is often an organization (the target buyer of enterprise software, i.e., product chooser) as represented by the purchasing officer, an executive or committee that makes a buying decision. \u25cf A customer is the target user only for consumer-facing products. For enterprise software, target users may be far from the process of choosing a product, and have no input about products the organization selects. Agile terminology adds to the confusion: product teams write user stories from the perspective of the person who uses the software, not the one who chooses it. Then a customer demo (or stakeholder review) at the end of an iteration confirms that each user story is satisfied. Here is when the terms customer and user are conflated. For enterprise software and large systems, practice teaches us that often the \u201cend-of-iteration customer\u201d is someone representing the product chooser rather than the end user. So the end-of-iteration demo cannot be the sole form of feedback to predict user adoption and satisfaction. In addition, the software development team should also leverage user research to answer questions such as: \u25cf What are the classes of users (personas)? \u25cf Have we validated that the intended users have the needs specified in the user stories? \u25cf What are the current user practices before the introduction of the product and the impact afterwards? \u25cf How would we extend the tool to support new personas or future use cases? Published on Communications of the ACM, September 2017: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126156 2.3 Internal proxies \u2260 target user The third case is about bias. Some teams work with their in-house professional services or sales support staff (i.e., experts thought to represent large groups of customers) as proxies for end users. While we appreciate the expertise and knowledge these resources bring, we are wary of two common types of misrepresentation in these situations. First, internal proxies are unrepresentative as end users because they have multiple unfair advantages: they know the software inside out, including the work-arounds; have access to internal tools unavailable to external customers; and do not need to use the product within the target users\u2019 time constraints or digital environment. Second, the evidence internal proxies bring to the team is also biased. Professional sales and support staff are more likely to channel the needs of the largest or most strategic existing customers in the marketplace. They are more likely to focus on pain points of the existing customers and less on what works well. Also, they may ignore new requirements that are not yet addressed by the current tool or market. Therefore internal staff cannot be the sole representative of \u201cusers\u201d (Figure 1). User research welcomes their comments about competitive analysis, current insights about information architecture or other issues, which complement customer support data, UX research, and other sources of user feedback. 2.4 Executives liking sales demos \u2260 target users adopting product Enterprise software companies, during their annual customer conferences, use a sales demo to portray features and functions intended to excite the audience of buyers, investors, and the market analysts about the company strategy. However, positive responses to the sales demos should not be taken as equivalent to assertions about product\u2019s user requirements. Instead, these requirements need confirmation via a careful validation cycle. Let sales demos open a door toward users with the help of choosers and influencers. Similarly, Customer Advisory Boards (which draw from customers who have large installations, or who represent a specific or important segment of the market) stand in for all customers and offer additional opportunities to showcase future features or strategy. However, a basic law for success in the software industry is \u201cBuild Once, Sell Many\u201d [7]. This principle creates an inherent tension between satisfying current customers and attracting new ones. Therefore, a software company needs to constantly rethink their tiered offerings to include new market segments or customer classes as these emerge, and avoid one-off development efforts. Confusing business leaders with users or the sales demo with the product prototype leads companies to build products based on what sales and product managers believe is awesome (e.g., see [6]). Instead, we advocate validating the designs with actual end users during the product development. 2.5 Big data (What? When?) < The full picture (... How? Why?) Collecting and analyzing big data about digital product use is popular among product managers and even software developers, who can now learn what features get traction with users. We support the use of big data techniques as part of user research and user-centered design, but not as a substitute for qualitative user research. Let\u2019s review 2 familiar ways to use big data on usage: User data analytics and A/B testing. User data analytics can quickly answer questions about current usage: quantity and most frequent patterns, such as How many? How often? When? Where? Once a product team has worked out most of the design (interaction patterns, page layouts, and more), A/B testing compares design alternatives, such as \u201cwhich image on a page produces more click-throughs\u201d? In vivo Published on Communications of the ACM, September 2017: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126156 experiments with sufficient traffic can generate large amount of useful data. Thus, A/B testing is very helpful for small incremental adjustments. Every software company is in the business of finding and keeping new customers. Suppose the logs show that the subscribers of an online dating application are not renewing. Should the company rejoice or despair? If people are getting good matches, and thus are satisfied, non-renewal implies success. If they are hopelessly disappointed by not getting dates, non-renewal implies failure. Big data won\u2019t tell you which, but observing and listening to even a handful of non-renewing individuals will. In brief, quantitative data is useful but has two limitations: First, it will not tell the team why the current features are or are not used [5]. Different classes of users can have different reasons. Second, it will not identify what additional or alternative features appeal to a new class of users unfa", "year": 2017}

P., McDonald, C. G., Battaglia, E., and O'Malley, M.K., 2018, ASME Appl. Mech. Rev., 70(1), p. 010804)", "abstract": "In their discussion article [1] on our review paper [2], Professors James Schmiedeler and Patrick Wensing have provided an insightful and informative perspective of the roles of intent detection, arbitration, and communication as three pillars of a framework for the implementation of shared control in physical human\u2013robot interaction (pHRI). The authors both have significant expertise and experience in robotics, bipedal walking, and robotic rehabilitation. Their commentary introduces commonalities between the themes of the review paper and issues in locomotion with the aid of an exoskeleton or lower-limb prostheses, and presents several important topics that warrant further exploration. These include mechanical design as it pertains to the physical coupling between human and robot, modeling the human to improve intent detection and the arbitration of control, and finite-state machines as an approach for implementation. In this closure, we provide additional thoughts and discussion of these topics as they relate to pHRI. We agree that mechanical design is an important consideration when developing robots for tasks that involve shared control and physical human\u2013robot interaction. In particular, robots that are working in close proximity to humans should be lightweight and compliant, so that\u2014if an unexpected collision occurs\u2014the human is not injured. Series elastic actuators (SEAs) have accordingly emerged as a desirable design element for pHRI. SEAs incorporate a compliant element between the actuator and the load, which beneficially reduces the robot\u2019s output impedance across the frequency spectrum. Interestingly, the mechanical design of SEAs contributes to all three aspects of shared control. By measuring the displacement of the compliant element, we can use SEAs to determine and control how much force the human is applying, which lends itself to both intent detection and communication. Moreover, by changing the position of the actuator as the human interacts, we can adjust the perceived stiffness of the SEA: this allows us to adjust the arbitration between human and robot. Recently, our research group has focused on determining the range of stiffnesses that an SEA can safely render to a human user, as well as developing control strategies to augment this range for both feedback and arbitration [4,5]. In summary, SEAs are an example of effective mechanical design for shared control applications, and\u2014by their nature\u2014SEAs enable intent detection, arbitration, and communication for pHRI. Schmiedeler and Wensing bring up the importance of modeling, particularly as it is useful to intent detection and arbitration. We strongly agree and would like to emphasize here how physical modeling of the human, robot, and the interface between them can bring about improvements in the state-of-the art for almost all of the areas discussed. Model-based control of rigid robotic manipulators is foundational to the field and has been extended nicely to more flexible robots intended to work alongside humans [6]. As we experience a shift in wearable robotics from rigid to more soft and flexible designs, the challenges of physical modeling seem to expand at the pace of design innovation. Whether the application involves flexible cable-based actuation or soft pneumatic actuation, accurate and robust physical modeling of the actuation and mechanical design is a necessary step in our development of controlled physical interactions between human and robot that are safe, reliable, and effective. On the human side of modeling, new tools such as OPENSIM [7] facilitate modeling of the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal structure, opening up the black box that connects externally measured kinematic and kinetic data with internal muscle and joint loading and even individual muscle excitations as could be measured through electromyography. It is the authors\u2019 hope that the field will find such models of the human neuromusculoskeletal system increasingly useful in detecting difficult-to-measure variables of human intent, experimentally validating existing model-based approaches to wearable robot design, and increasing the specificity of the regulation of human effort during arbitration for applications such as rehabilitation. Schmiedeler and Wensing have also pointed out that finite-state machines can be leveraged to detect the human\u2019s intent or to change the arbitration during shared control. This is especially true when the human\u2019s intent\u2014or more generally, the human\u2019s objective\u2014belongs to a discrete set of possible objectives. In work by Javdani et al. [8], the human\u2019s objective is a goal position, and the robot has a belief over the space of possible goals. As the human takes actions toward their desired goal, the robot updates its belief, and takes actions to maximize the robot\u2019s expected reward. Later works considered the effects that robot actions can have on the human\u2019s objective: if the human is willing to adapt, the robot can take actions to convince the human that their current goal is suboptimal, and then cause the human to switch to the optimal goal. Knowing that the human has a discrete set of possible intents makes these problems tractable and allows us to implement finitestate machines to learn the human\u2019s intent in real time. Finite-state machines can also be used to switch between different levels of autonomy\u2014but we must be careful to ensure that these changes do not destabilize the system. Although finite-state machines are a reasonable starting point, moving forward we expect that shared control systems for pHRI will increasingly work in continuous intent and arbitration spaces. For example, the human may be happy with the robot\u2019s goal position, but unhappy with the robot\u2019s trajectory Manuscript received January 23, 2018; final manuscript received January 23, 2018; published online February 20, 2018.

Based on our analysis of real-world users, we show that the dynamics of blind users cannot be accounted for by a single universal model but instead must be learned on an individual basis. To learn personalized instructional interfaces, we propose PING (Personalized INstruction Generation agent), a model-based reinforcement learning framework which aims to quickly adapt its state transition dynamics model to match the reactions of the user using a novel end-to-end learned weighted majority-based regression algorithm. In our experiments, we show that PING learns dynamics models significantly faster compared to baseline transfer learning approaches on real-world data. We find that through better reasoning over personal mobility nuances, interaction with surrounding obstacles, and the current navigation task, PING is able to improve the performance of instructional assistive navigation at the most crucial junctions such as turns or veering paths. To enable sufficient planning time over user responses, we emphasize prediction of human motion for long horizons. Specifically, the learned dynamics models are shown to consistently improve long-term position prediction by over 1 meter on average (nearly the width of a hallway) compared to baseline approaches even when considering a prediction horizon of 20 seconds into the future.", "year": 2018}

Most are at risk and are in need because they are subsisting on a fixed income, whose buying power continues to fall over time, and who live at or below the poverty level. Many also have medical bills that consume much of their income, which forces them to put off needed home repairs and modifications. This population generally includes but is not limited to senior citizens, the disabled, families with children, single parent households, and veterans. Using this as a springboard, the national office administers an annual affiliate survey 1 at the end of each calendar year. The purpose of the survey is to collect data from their affiliates for the past calendar year so the national office can measure and articulate its collective impact. While the affiliate conducts surveys and collects other data, it does so because it has to, like so many other non-profits . Their measures frequently are reasonable estimates more than anything because repairs and modifications for homeowners is the priority given their limited resources. This is also due in part to the lack of the skill sets needed to differentiate between terms like evaluation, assessment, outputs, outcomes, and impact and other resources needed to assess. It is also due to the need to collect data that are needed by the national office that the affiliate may not use. Tuan , as an example, cautions nonprofits to be aware of drowning in data or collecting data because it is easy, measuring things that are not important, asking the wrong questions, and the like. The key according to Tuan is asking why the data are being collected and whether something will be done with the data once it is collected. With this in mind, a Public Service Fellow (PSF) was retain through East Carolina University\u2019s Public Service Fellows program, which was supported by the State Employees Credit Union Foundation. All PSF projects are aimed at community-identified priorities. Fellows might be tasked with exploring community and economic development, grant writing, or project implementation involving discipline-based skills learned through academic programs that range from graphic design to engineering. The Fellows Program includes professional and leadership development components. Specifically, all PSF students attend workshops to teach communication (written as well as oral), business etiquette, networking, and professional practice. The Fellows are asked to read a common text that challenges them to think about the role public service will play in their career. They become familiar with types leadership style through discussions about leadership theory and practice. Hence, the PSF program allows students to develop a better understanding of the collaborative nature of public sector issues that impact community sustainability, growth, and well-being while strengthening core competencies gained through academic programs and experiential learning (S. Paynter, personal communication, February 21, 2017). The PSF student selected for this project was a double major\u2014industrial engineering technology and design. They worked with the affiliate\u2019s executive director; its two AmeriCorps members, whose role was to increase the capacity of their assigned affiliate to serve additional low-income homeowners through volunteer recruitment, client outreach, repairs for low-income homeowners, new project implementation, community partnership development, and program expansion; and a host institution faculty member. Project design and execution. The product for this project was a user friendlier means for collecting and compiling data. The outcome envisioned was a collection of data that better characterizes the affiliate\u2019s outputs, which could be used to articulate the affiliate\u2019s outcomes and impact. To achieve the project\u2019s vision, a data collection interface 4, 5, 6, 7 was produced. It was anticipated that this would improve the response rate, increase accuracy, and make the collection and compilation of data less arduous: all of which are current limitations to the affiliate\u2019s ability to collect and compile data. That is, rather than collecting and compiling data by means of direct entry into a spreadsheet, a survey instrument would be used as the means for compiling the affiliate\u2019s output data. Normally, as it is with classroom test construction, the first order of business when developing a survey is the development of a table of specifications (TOS) . The purpose of a TOS in test construction is to ensure there is alignment between the instructional objectives and the items that appear on the test. This helps to ensure the test results tell whether the instructional objectives are being achieved. Thus with a survey too there must be alignment between the data needed to convey a message and the message that needs to be conveyed. Because the national office requires all its affiliates to report summary data annually, the raw material for the TOS and the resulting survey items were readily available, were digitized, and became part of the data collection tool. However, because the local affiliate also collects data\u2014 as an example additional home and homeowner data, a decision was made to include all items in the survey by melding it with the annual affiliate survey items. Because of its availability, Qualtrics , a browser-based survey software, was used to construct the survey instrument. A major concern though was whether the affiliate would always have access to Qualtrics. It was anticipated that as long as adequate documentation was archived, the affiliate could transition to an alternative survey software, such as the ubiquitous SurveyMonkey. A portion of the homeowner application is shown in Figure 1. These data are collected and form the basis for reporting the affiliate\u2019s outputs. A portion of the affiliate\u2019s health and safety priorities is shown in Figure 2. These data too are collected and used to report on the affiliate\u2019s health and safety outputs. An item from the annual affiliate survey appears in Figure 3. This item is used to collect data on the affiliate\u2019s programs. For this affiliate, it included its two programs: Green Housing and Safe at Home (aka Health and Safety). It should be noted that the affiliate reported on its outputs rather than its impact in the Program Accomplishments column. Figure 1.

Lessons learned through successes or failures. Like most non-profits, the affiliate knows that, properly done, the collection and analysis of data can yield new knowledge, which can be used to improve its processes. The affiliate also knows it has a responsibility to its community engagement stakeholders and it knows the sustainability of the affiliate depends on effectively assessing their efforts and articulating the results. In response, the affiliate undertook an initiative to improve its ability to articulate its impact\u2014specifically its means for collecting and compiling data on its activities. One of the glaring lessons learned during the course of this project was underestimating the time it would take to formulate the online survey items, even though many of the items had been previously formulated. Another lesson learned was the discovery that far more data, duplicate in some cases, were bei", "year": 2017}

We consider the following MANET mobility models: Random Waypoint, Random Direction, Gauss-Markov, City Section and Manhattan mobility models. Simulations have been conducted for various network density and node mobility levels. The performance metrics studied include the lifetime per multi-path set, the multi-path set size and the average hop count per multi-path. For almost every simulation condition, we observe the Gauss-Markov mobility model to yield the least number of multi-paths, but the lifetime per multi-path set under this mobility model is the maximum. The Random Direction mobility model yields the smallest lifetime per multi-path set, even though it yields a relatively larger number of multi-paths. ABSTRACT In this paper we present a distributed self-organizing trust based clustering framework for securing ad hoc networks. The mobile nodes are vulnerable to security attacks, so ensuring the security of the network is essential. To enhance security, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes without depending on central authorities. In our proposal the evidence of trustworthiness is captured in an efficient manner and from broader perspectives including direct interactions with neighbors, observing interactions of neighbors and through recommendations. Our prediction scheme uses a trust evaluation algorithm at each node to calculate the direct trust rating normalized as a fuzzy value between zero and one. The evidence theory of Dempster-Shafer [7], [8] used in order to combine the evidences collected by a clusterhead itself and the recommendations from other neighbor nodes. Moreover, in our scheme we do not restrict to a single gateway node for inter cluster routing. ABSTRACT When a Mobile Ad Hoc network (MANET) is connected to the Internet, it is important for mobile nodes to detect available Internet gateway (IGW) providing access to the Internet. Gateway discovery time have strong influence on packet delay and throughput. In most of the cases, a mobile node uses min- hops to the gateway to communicate a fixed host connected to an Internet. However, a minimum hop path may not always be efficient if some nodes along the path have longer interface queue of waiting packets. Thus, the focus of the paper is to first analyse existing load-aware routing protocols in MANET and then based on this analysis, devise a proactive load-aware gateway discovery scheme that takes in to account size of interface queue in addition to the traditional min hop metric. This approach also allows an efficient handoff from one Internet gateway to another Internet gateway and still maintains a seamless connectivity to a fixed host. We examine the impact of traffic load and node mobility in terms of two metrics: throughput and average end-to-end delay to assess the performance of the proposed protocol. Simulation results indicate that our protocol outperforms existing solution. Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are very considered attractive for many applications. Routing protocol is considered as the most important element of MANET. However, Media streaming over MANET is a quite demanding task. In this paper the performances of MANET routing protocols have been investigated for video applications. Some popular routing protocols namely Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA), Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR), and Geographic Routing Protocol (GRP) have been considered in this paper. A comparative performance analysis of these routing protocols has been presented in this paper for supporting video streaming applications. ABSTRACT This paper proposes a reliable system to overcome the weakness of current the HF radio communication system for oceanic aeronautical flight routes. This system uses only one aeronautical VHF channel with air-toair radio relay system based on local mobile Ad-hoc networks. For access to/from all aircrafts in the system, a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) scheme is proposed to be used where each aircraft is assigned one time slot during its presence in the system in order to transmit its own packet by itself or relay them using neighbouring aircrafts. These packets contain aircraft position, ID, relative direction which are used to build a routing table at each aircraft. In addition, several algorithms for relaying packets; schemes to reduce the packet-loss-ratio as well as to reduce the interference caused by surrounding aircrafts have been proposed. The simulations have shown the improvement of such proposals when examining system performance under real air-traffic scenarios. This system strengthens the reliability of oceanic aeronautical communication and increases situational awareness of all oceanic flights as an effective solution to operate more flights on the ocean but in higher safety. ABSTRACT Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an infrastructure less and decentralized network which need a robust dynamic routing protocol. Many routing protocols for such networks have been proposed so far to find optimized routes from source to the destination and prominent among them are Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV), and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocols. The performance comparison of these protocols should be considered as the primary step towards the invention of a new routing protocol. This paper presents a performance comparison of proactive and reactive routing protocols DSDV, AODV and DSR based on QoS metrics (packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, throughput, jitter), normalized routing overhead and normalized MAC overhead by using the NS-2 simulator. The performance comparison is conducted by varying mobility speed, number of nodes and data rate. The comparison results show that AODV performs optimally well not the best among all the studied protocols. ABSTRACT Mobile ad hoc networks are becoming an important concept of modern communication technologies and services. It provides some advantages to this communication world such as self-organizing and decentralization. In this paper, we are going to design a clusterbased multi source multicast routing protocol with new cluster head election, path construction and maintenance techniques. The main objective of this work to compute the maximum performance of proposed routing protocol in various environments, and also it has been compared with Multicast Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (MAODV) and On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) to prove the performance of delivery ratio, control overhead and forwarding efficiency. ABSTRACT At the same time as the emergence of multimedia in mobile Ad hoc networks, research for the introduction of the quality of service (QoS) has received much attention. However, when designing a QoS solution, the estimation of the available resources still represents one of the main issues. This paper suggests an approach to estimate available resources on a node. This approach is based on the estimation of the busy ratio of the shared canal. We consider in our estimation the several constraints related to the Ad hoc transmission mode such as Interference phenomena. This approach is implemented on the AODV routing protocol. We call AODVwithQOS our new routing protocol. We also performed a performance evaluation by simulations using NS2 simulator. The results confirm that AODVwithQoS provides QoS support in ad hoc wireless networks with good performance and low overhead. 802.11b in Ad hoc configurations\u201d. ABSTRACT This paper proposes a cross-layer based cognitive radio multichannel medium access control (MAC) protocol with TDMA, which integrate the spectrum sensing at physical (PHY) layer and the packet scheduling at MAC layer, for the ad hoc wireless networks. The IEEE 802.11 standard allows for the use of multiple channels available at the PHY layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. A single channel MAC protocol does not work well in a multichannel environment, because of the multichannel hidden terminal problem. Our proposed protocol enables secondary users (SUs) to utilize multiple channels by switching channels dynamically, thus increasing network throughput. In our proposed protocol, each SU is equipped with only one spectrum agile transceiver, but solves the multichannel hidden terminal problem using temporal synchronization. The proposed cognitive radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocol allows SUs to identify and use the unused frequency spectrum in a way that constrains the level of interference to the primary users (PUs). Our scheme improves network throughput significantly, especially when the network is highly congested. The simulation results show that our proposed CR-MAC protocol successfully exploits multiple channels and significantly improves network performance by using the licensed spectrum band opportunistically and protects PUs from interference, even in hidden terminal situations. ABSTRACT In this paper, we present an identity (ID) based protocol that secures AODV and TCP so that it can be used in dynamic and attack prone environments of mobile ad hoc networks. The proposed protocol protects AODV using Sequential Aggregate Signatures (SAS) based on RSA. It also generates a session key for each pair of source-destination nodes of a MANET for securing the end-to-end transmitted data. Here each node has an ID which is evaluated from its public key and the messages that are sent are authenticated with a signature/ MAC. The proposed scheme does not allow a node to change its ID throughout the network lifetime. Thus it makes the network secure against attacks that target AODV and TCP in MANET", "year": 2018}

The reuse and enhancement of a public asset of immense size no longer used for public purposes and at risk of abandonment is a challenge for the Italian territories and for the government finances. \nFor a long time, the lawmaker's effort in this field has focused on facilitating the public procedures for the alienation of public buildings. The bases of these policies were the need to enter the property on the market to entrust them to operators which would hold the appropriate financial resources and knowledge able to redevelop the buildings and ensure new uses. \nAt an ex-post evaluation, facilitation and market access measures through traditional valuation tools have not yielded the hoped outcome. Growing downturns on real estate sales may be similar to the market for non-performing loans - estimated at no more than 30% of their real value as reported by the Bank of Italy - imposes new solutions to avoid the sale and the abandonment of such assets. \nIn public real-estate assets suspended among the negligence of the administrations and the exclusion from the traditional real estate market logic, in recent years innovative forms of enhancement of public real-estate properties took place. These are promoted by a citizenship that is eager to get involved in enhancing its territory. If traditional operators no longer have the interest or resources to transform public areas and buildings, the creative class, represented by associations, artists and companies, fab-lab, creative industries, digital manufacturing workshops, craft workshops and professional firms, rediscovers abandoned real estate assets to launch innovation projects with cultural and social purposes. At the core of these activities is the desire to restart the territories affected by the structural crisis that has hit our country through culture and the sharing of projects and ideas. \nThe present research aims to study these innovative forms of enhancement of public real-estate properties promoted from bottom-up processes, from initiatives taken by local citizenship. In particular, the goal is to identify the conditions for predicting the success of such projects and, from a real-estate economics point of view, to what extent similar actors can generate new economic value in the enhanced real-estate assets. \nOften, governments encourage the development of similar initiatives that revitalize properties and establish new ecosystem with culture and enterprise, simultaneously promoting economic development and urban regeneration. From reserve of financial value, public properties are thus transformed into new commons, of which citizenship reappears to start new social and economic activities. \nAlthough bottom-up processes are a well-established procedure in Europe, in the literature the theme is still experimental. For this reason, research is based on the analysis and interpretation of some empirical successful experiences in Italy and it can be distinguished in three phases. \nA first experimental survey was conducted on fifteen successful case studies in Italy. The basics of descriptive statistics have allowed us to identify some of the elements common to most of the experiences. Among them, the importance of active citizenship, temporary uses, the conceptual framework of commons and the attractiveness of creative industries. \nThe second step explores in more detail the dynamics of bottom-up processes and deepens some aspects of macro and micro-territorial scale. The dataset has been expanded through fifty experiences that have been explored through multivariate statistics techniques. In particular, cluster analysis has allowed identifying some internal groups to the datasets with similar characteristics. From the analysis emerged some elements that can represent many predictors for the success of the bottom-up enhancement experiences in Italy. From the macro-territorial point of view, the importance of the endowment of social capital in a territory has emerged. Large cities have always been characterized by a high level of social and human capital and, for this reason, bottom-up processes are typically an urban phenomenon. Nevertheless, similar mechanisms can also occur where social capital is latent. In this case, administrations have promoted specific public policies to stimulate citizenship to pursue such initiatives. \nFrom the micro-territorial scale, the cluster analysis allowed to identify some architectural, managerial and legal aspects. Bottom-up enhancement processes take place in small buildings in a good state of conservation. Such mechanisms require an emblematic figure, the social entrepreneur, to ensure their economic sustainability. From a legal perspective, flexibility is the necessary element to ensure contractual formulas that are appropriate to the needs of proprietary and the users of the assets. \nIf the positive externalities that bottom-up processes generate locally (new jobs, urban regeneration, new community services) are clear, the economic benefits, from a purely real-estate point of view, are less evident. The third step concerns the value creation process that similar mechanisms are able to generate in the enhanced asset. The discounted cash flow analysis conducted on a case study is the procedure employed to estimate the value generated by bottom-up processes. To measure in the high degree of uncertainty associated with the value chain that characterizes bottom-up initiatives, the estimation model has been combined with the Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that from a near-zero initial value, bottom-up processes have contributed to increasing this value, demonstrating how similar processes represent a valid alternative to traditional administrative procedures for enhancing abandoned property assets. \nFrom a practical point of view, research highlights new perspectives for enhancing public property assets and provides a valid support for administrations to promote similar practices. \nFinally, scientific results link two issues - the enhancement of public real-estate assets and bottom-up processes - which are now treated distinctly in the literature and show the effectiveness of such practices in the regeneration of territories.", "year": 2018}

This surgical technique allows the correction of the Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) [1]. TTTS is a severe complication in monochorionic twins\u2019 pregnancies that occurs when there is communication (anastomoses) between the fetuses\u2019 blood systems, which leads to cardiovascular disturbances and results in their death in 90% of cases. A minimally invasive approach is less harmful and allows the preservation of the tissues of the amniotic sac. Fetoscopic Laser Photocoagulation (FLP) is a MIS intervention to ablate all the intertwin anastomoses to make independent the twins\u2019 vascular systems from each other [2]. A single master single slave teleoperation platform was developed to assist the surgeon during FLP, Fig. 1. The master is composed of a 6DoF haptic device and an interactive user interface containing fetoscopic view, interactive navigation map, etc. The slave is composed of 6DoF robot holding a fetoscope, an active trocar insertion depth control and an automated coagulation laser control system. The platform has been tested by 14 surgeons with different fetoscopic surgical experience, obtaining the face validity. Two main issues have been detected. First, the need of a redundant robot to overcome the kinematic restrictions imposed by the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) and the workspace placement, defined by the placenta position. Second, the need of active humanrobot interaction during pre and post-operative phases (insertion and extraction of the fetoscope) and during surgery to enable a safe shared workspace between medical staff (e.g. auxiliary surgeon with an echographer probe) and robot. Following the generalized framework for control of redundant manipulators in RMIS proposed in [3], this paper proposes a multi-task control strategy exploiting redundancy to improve dexterity and reachability as well as enable human-robot interaction to deal with humanrobot collisions and co-manipulation while performing the surgical task. This work is based on a 7 DoF KUKA LWR 4, a redundant and collaborative robot.", "year": 2020}

And, we classify these factors into product quality factors and supporting service factors for new products. We then explore the relationship between online reviews and purchase decisions under these different factors, and also further explore the impact of interactions between online review metrics on purchase decisions. Our findings suggest that the impact of online reviews on consumer purchase decisions also varies considerably across different consumer focus factors. In addition, we find that the impact of the interaction between online review features is complex. In particular, consumers do not follow the positive guidance and make purchase decisions as we would expect when confronted with a large number of positive emotional polarity online reviews. Meanwhile, the interaction between negative emotional polarity and variance of online reviews had no significant effect on consumer purchase decisions. The variance of online reviews has a limited role in reducing consumer risk perceptions triggered by negative emotional polarity. Our study provides new evidence for the study of the impact of online reviews through text mining.", "year": 2022}

It has been observed by Nosto.com that a personalized web app experience generates approximately 1.3 times higher conversion rates, 18% higher average order amount as well as on an average two times increase in the customer time spent online. Most of our systems are not utilizing the data analytics in an efficient manner. While we focus on the historical transactional data, a better solution would be to change the page dynamically using behavioral data, which accounts for about 98% of data captured online and remains untouched (according to Nosto.com). An organization's emails need to be targeted and segmented based on user value, their time zone and date of purchase. Creating user communities, gamifying reward programs and referrals are other ways to establish the personalization brand of an organization. Social media dynamic ad campaigns need to be targeted using user generated content along with reviews which according to Yotpo.com would give a 62% increased return on ad spend. Care can also be shown by using feedback and negative feedback to our advantage.All these factors can help to establish any organization as a person-centric Brand and help in increasing the revenues by focusing more on repeat customers who spend 67% more than one time shoppers on an average, (according to business.com experts) ,thus establishing regular cohorts.

Participatory processes increasingly apply strategies and dynamics borrowed from games to promote a more diverse demographic of engagement and to incentivize desirable behaviour by the participants. While many scholars and practitioners highlight the practical benefits of gamification, other warn us of the potential risks of the ludification of public participation, especially if applied in a learning context. Under which conditions would game-like dynamics enhance public participation? What are the democratic risks of gamification in an educational context? This study explores the advantages and disadvantages of gamification applied to public participation in context of education, using a large multi-site simulation based on the Empaville platform. The activities involved around 200 students from the ages of 10 to 18, in five different Portuguese schools. The role play-game simulated a gamified participatory budgeting process integrating in-person deliberation with digital voting. Using a mixed method approach that combines the analysis of the game patterns, surveys and participant observation, the paper explores under what conditions gamification can activate a \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d that promotes participants\u2019 autonomy and empowerment from a school age. Key terms: Gamification, democratic innovations, e-democracy, participatory democracy, participatory budgeting. \uf02a marcomeloni@ces.uc.pt sofiaantunes@ces.uc.pt Introduction The term gamification has roots in the digital media industry, particularly in the context of video games. Deterding (2014) defined it as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. This dynamic entails gameful elements such as: rules, competition, outcomes and conflict executed by the users towards an end goal. This allows users to be rewarded, paving the way for a revival in \u201cplayful desire behaviours and mindsets\u201d (Deterding et al. 2011, pp. 9-15). Consequently, gamification aims to create a common space for an enjoyable user experience, expanding into something more than solely for entertainment purposes. This paper furthermore aims to highlight some perceptions reviewed in gaming literature. In particular, how gamification can foster and strengthen the common good and overall political participation. In this sense, Pateman (2012) argued that in the modernisation of politics citizens should not only be consumers, contrasting the Schumpeterian (1942) notion of democracy that saw \u201ccitizens as merely consumers in another guise\u201d. Gee (2003) transferred this concept by attaching the user in the role of developer instead of consumer, i.e. a co-creator of the gaming world that would also participate within it. This paper will analyse gamification in the decision-making process of citizen participation, questioning if and how games can foster the direct interaction of citizens with governmental agencies alongside promoting community collaboration and direct action. The paper begins with the overall explanation of gamification, followed by a more specific section focusing on the relation between gamification and democracy. The third section frames gamification in the context of learning. The fourth examines the features of the role-playing game Empaville for School and it includes two sub-sections dedicated to the gamification elements and objectives of the simulation. The fifth analyses the activities carried out by the survey and participant observation. Finally, the conclusion highlights opportunities and challenges for future developments. 1. Explaining gamification To better understand the concept of gamification, an analysis of the terminology in literature is fundamental. Caillois (2001) conceptualized gamification through two distinguishable fields: ludus (gaming) and paidia (playing), which entails the creation of a playing-space, which is more creative, open, probing and free. Despite this general definition, this paper aims to go beyond the intersecting and blurred conceptualization of gamification. The reflection of gamification as complement of playfulness (Deterding et al. 2011) paved the way to depict a space for a societal approach rather than a technical one. Under this perspective, gamification in terms of the context and demographic of users, should not be scrutinised as a \u201cone size fits all\u201d model. The authors of this paper envisage gamification as a process that increases users\u2019 motivation and fun while encouraging them to come back to the game. Deterding (2011), Mahnic (2014) and Thiel (2016) defined this dynamic as engaging experience. This can be perceived through interface design patterns such as badges, levels, or leaderboards, that paly a valuable role towards community recognition, which may also include non-game contexts. Along these previous elements, Thiel (2016) also pointed out the role of the status that users can acquire by reaching certain levels of the game. Each achievement is recognized within the community, turning their engagement into social reward. Other game elements are included in gamification, such as feedback, challenges and competition among the leader boards, challenged by time constraints. All these elements drive the user to a more enjoyable and engaging experience. The success of gamification is intertwined with how much the users\u2019 interaction can be more appealing and rewarded, i.e. how they can be more motivated to maintain their engagement. In conclusion, it is possible to recognize two sides of the behavioral motivation in the experience: one intrinsic and one extrinsic. Some authors such as Manhic (2014), Sanchez-Franco (2009), Thiel (2016) and Hassan (2017) pointed out that intrinsic motivations are consequently rooted around pleasure and amusement on performing the activity. The extrinsic motivations are translated by the mechanisms/elements that are rooted in the game design through a reward-based approach. Therefore, gamification will be successfully achieved if the emotional responses and its intrinsic positive effects can be balanced with the utilitarian extrinsic way of being motivated. 2. Gamification and democracy This paper investigates to what extent public participation can be more enjoyable and how gamification can have a positive impact toward democracy. Some authors, such as, Pateman (2012) and Lerner (2014) pointed out the decrease of political participation and its risks. In particular, Lerner affirmed that the democracy \u201cturning what once were social processes into individualized tasks with little human interaction\u201d (p. 8). The possibility of participation has been diminished, transforming the decision-making process into becoming alienated from citizens, ruled and owned by elites. Taking this into consideration, gamification can be seen as a process to enhance democracy by promoting participation. In this perspective, as argued by Lerner (2014), games are inherently democratic as they invite the people to participate, implying deliberation and influencing the decision-making. Through deliberation it is possible to provide the concept of a gamified democracy, as they are intertwined concepts, starting from citizen discussion on civic matters. This is the first step to allow discussion and deliberation among citizens and democratic institutions. Thiel (2016) categorized and analysed some e-participation platforms in order to examine to what extent deliberation can be promoted by a gamified democracy. The results reflected a very limited and narrow deliberation of the participatory projects. Indeed, the majority of these projects present a typology of participation rooted on citizen-sourcing and public deliberation. The same author (2016) noticed a passive way of citizen engagement generally through deliberation limited to prescriptive agendas, already established. Even in public deliberation processes, citizen interaction among different parts was almost inexistent, despite being able put forward the topics that they were interested in. In that study it was identified that none of the processes analysed had developed a good channel of engagement and interaction. Although partial, this evaluation underlined some widespread limitations within this kind of platform. Firstly, administrators of the institutions and stakeholders tend to not be committed to giving feedback and interacting in the process. Secondly, generally only a small part of the citizens actively take part in the deliberation and decision-making process on the platforms. As it has been mentioned above, it is important to redefine gamification as a concept that largely should contribute to the common good. What are the advantages and challenges of integrating gamification in democracy? Gaming promote the interaction between citizens and institution and enhance community building. Participants can experiment in real or simulated public decision-making processes and learn from them. Learning how to participate, citizens can overcome the perception of exclusion, gaining more confidence, while seeking to improve the public decisions\u2019 quality. Thus, citizens can have a more active role within democratic institutions. This will contribute to the empowerment of both the community and the individual, as well as for the overall public education. Moreover, gamification could also reduce costs of public engagement initiatives. Gamification can also decrease citizen alienation from politics and society in general. Mahnic (2014) argued that through crowdsourcing, individuals could better perceive their role within the community, \u201coutsourcing a job to the crowd\u201d, for the common good. Wikipedia is an illustrative example of how working for the community can provide effective involvement. Giving their contribution according to their own knowledge and skills, citizens take part in a broader policy-making life cycle. Macintosh (2004) described this cycle through five main stages.

However, effective integration of serious games in education depends on addressing two big challenges: the successful incorporation of motivation and engagement that can lead to learning; and the highly specialised skills associated with customised development to meet the required pedagogical objectives. This paper presents the Westminster Serious Games Platform (wmin-SGP) an authoring tool that allows educators/domain experts without games design and development technical skills to create bespoke roleplay simulations in three dimensional scenes featuring fully embodied virtual humans capable of verbal and non-verbal interaction with users fit for specific educational objectives.

Thanks to the company\u2019s extensive, wide-ranging product portfolio in the areas of planning, building and use, Nemetschek AG is able to offer integrated process solutions and consistent, end-to-end IT support for the relevant disciplines throughout the entire structure life cycle. In this contribution several strategies are presented to realize an integrated Product Lifecycle Management. 2 PROCESS INTEGRATION 2.1 Integrated cost management Integrated costing plays a central role in this respect. Characterized as \u201cdesign to cost\u201d, Nemetschek\u2019s software versions 2006 allow users to harness even more advantages of integrated design, in particular in the field of integrated costing (CAD systems \u2013 programs for tendering, ordering and billing). In addition to quantity takeoff operations based on graphics, the individual processes including all the planning and construction phases are linked and access the same master data. This way, users can combine data in order to run analyses and evaluations based on a wide range of different criteria like costs, time, geometry, quantities and articles. Nemetschek\u2019s integrated solutions aim to harness all the advantages provided by an efficient and interdisciplinary flow of information based on a common database, facilitating better and more reliable costing and scheduling procedures.

As the structure of the construction industry is changing and the spatial factor of project structures is losing importance, networking and cooperative project handling will become more and more important. With the markets being increasingly opened up and globalized, the economic situation in the European construction industry imposes growing demands on efficient project execution and tight schedules. Using IT-based products and networks, cooperation needs to be optimized in terms of logistics in order to improve the processes of designing, building and managing and to achieve a strong competitive position. An important aspect is to improve technical interfaces and to create a database that consistently manages all the building data involved. Sophisticated interfaces ensure that all processes run smoothly and the various applications and systems interact seamlessly. Instead of managing individual parts of processes in the life cycle of buildings using isolated applications, this approach provides integrated support and improves the quality of processes. However, these cooperative activities also impose ever-increasing demands on communication and coordination. Nemetschek\u2019s collaboration strategy is specially designed for these demands: an important factor is to integrate all those involved \u2013 and thus their expertise and knowledge \u2013 in the building process and to synchronize their work. This is achieved by the creation of a collaborative framework, which coordinates the actual designing and building processes, making them as efficient as possible. Nemetschek AG offers powerful document management and office organization systems as well as web-based project rooms providing workflow functions and improving communication. 3 INTEGRATION OF MOBILE ON-SITE SOLUTIONS For a consistent integration of processes, it is essential that all the processes taking place directly on the building site be supported and integrated. To facilitate site management, Nemetschek provides various mobile software module referred to as Nemetschek On-Site-Solutions. This product label includes tools for entering and managing defect records as well as checking and monitoring progress. As an example, the following sections briefly introduce Nemetschek\u2019s On-Site Inspector and On-Site ProgressManager.

The possible applications for the On-Site Inspector are manifold: besides the capability of using it to accomplish all kinds of tasks that are not constructionrelated, the On-Site Inspector is especially designed for entering defect records directly on site. Using a tablet PC, alphanumeric data is associated with information provided in plans and/or drawings. Photos, sound and video files can be added to describe the defects in more detail. Nemetschek\u2019s On-Site Inspector features a \u2018defect takeup mode\u2019 for entering defects and a \u2018defect revision mode\u2019 for monitoring and checking progress. Figure 2: entering defects in a mobile and quick manner using tablet PC, digital camera, video and voice input Figure 3: processes involved in defect management After the defects have been entered, the data can be transferred to defect management systems for further processing via freely configurable interfaces. The PlugIn technology used facilitates a transfer to and application of various other programs. By default, Nemetschek\u2019s On-Site Inspector includes tools for exporting and importing data in Excel and XML format. In addition, interfaces to building portals and defect management systems can be purchased, ensuring data and media consistency and reducing the time and effort spent managing data in all the phases of a project. This way, customers can harness all the advantages provided by a consistent process encompassing on-site data entry to data administration through to final acceptance. 3.2 On-Site ProgressManager By launching the new On-Site ProgressManager, Nemetschek presents a cutting-edge program for entering data and monitoring progress directly on the building site. This program provides a convenient way of entering and saving detailed information on a building\u2019s degree of completion directly on site. This information can then be edited in the office.

A total of 45 articles were reviewed from an initial set of 527 articles following an inclusion-exclusion criterion. As outcomes, in addition to synthesizing the present research activities, this review revealed a total of 16 design considerations or guidelines that may improve the usability, user experience, and adoption of software systems to illiterate and semi-literate people. The revealed design considerations were also investigated concerning the country context and application platform. Finally, a set of good rules categorized into five perspectives (uses of text, interaction pattern, uses of pictography, uses of audio-video, and info-architecture) were revealed to design and evaluate software systems to make them more usable to the illiterate and semi-literate users. The review also reveals future research opportunities that include: exploring the design considerations with respect to context-dependent applications; investigating the design requirements for public IT (e.g., vending machines and kiosks) systems; adopting the semiotic concept in UI design; developing a new usability evaluation framework; and exploring the effects of multi-platform and cross-country app design. Thus, the implication of this study is to discover the research gaps and provide future research directions aiming to design applications for illiterate and semi-literate users with enhanced usability and UX.", "year": 2023}

However, little is known about factors influencing the review generation process. Thus, this paper empirically examines the impact of cross-organizational spillover effects on user-generated online service reviews. Specifically, we study how the overall perception of consumers towards a service provider expressed in online reviews is affected by upstream service providers in interdependent service chains (ISCs). Based on the Treatment-By-Association (TBA) phenomenon, we design a research model to study both the existence and evolvement of cross-organizational spillover effects in online reviews of ISCs. Utilizing every airline and airport review posted over 13 years on www.AirlineQuality.com, we show that both positive and negative spillover effects exist: Increased (decreased) overall ratings of an upstream service node are associated with increased (decreased) ratings of the directly following service node in the ISC. In addition, we show that this is not true for more distantly arranged service nodes. We contribute to the IS research stream of online reviews by shedding light on spillover effects and by providing evidence for the proposed TBA. Furthermore, suggestions how practitioners could manage and utilize spillover effects to improve their customer experience are provided.", "year": 2016}

Much dark design is constructed with monetization as the primary goal- even in spaces without ecommerce design (e.g., free-to-play apps representing >95% of all mobile apps; Fitton et al. 2021). Many recent dark design strategies are also oriented towards collecting user information. Concerns about children\u2019s vulnerability to inappropriate online marketing and economic fraud, and the impact of organisational data collection upon children\u2019s privacy are increasing (European Commission, 2022; OECD, 2011; OFCOM, 2022). Regulators have begun to recognize, challenge, and fine deceptive design practices aimed at children (e.g., $245 million Epic Games settlement; FTC 2022), however, the scope and extent of dark design practices is such that regulators alone cannot safeguard children from such practices. Parents, who are widely understood to be primarily responsible for children\u2019s online experiences, and children themselves, need to be mindful of and resistant to dark design practices in online spaces. With this in mind, this paper explores the following questions:\n\n(a) What is the influence of dark design (1) across mediums (e.g., apps, video games, social media platforms, websites) and (2) across differently-aged children?\n\n(b) To what extent are parents aware of their children\u2019s exposure to dark design and the risks such exposure poses?\n\n(c) How effective are marketplace and regulatory controls?", "year": 2023}

In this method, the virtual robot modeled according to the remote real robot is projected into the real local environment to form a 3D operation interface. In this case, users can directly interact with virtual objects by their hands. Furthermore, since the Leap Motion is attached to the augmented reality (AR) glasses, the operation space is greatly extended. Therefore, users can observe the virtual robot from an arbitrary angle without blind angle in such a mobile pattern, which enhances the users\u2019 interactive immersion and provides more natural human-machine interaction. To improve the accuracy of the measurement, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and an improved particle filter (IPF) are used to estimate the position and orientation of the hand, respectively. Furthermore, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and maximum entropy model are adopted to recognize the speech and gestures instructions of the user. The proposed method is compared with the three human-machine methods on various experiments. The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2019}

{"paperId": "9a7aa8f7c48a944b85be1e49fde16d74bd2ce06b", "title": "Advancing Adventure Education Using Digital Motion-Sensing Games", "abstract": "Introduction Adventure education involves various adventurous and challenging types of group activity, and was established by the Outward Bound School in the United States and Europe through the field activities of boy-scout courses. In 1970, Jerry Pieh and Gary Baker used various types of simple portable tools in their Project Adventure course and integrated outdoor activities into general courses that enable students to learn teamwork, communication, leadership, and introspection (Prouty, 1990). Adventure education emphasizes learning through experience and cultivates the self-confidence, interpersonal interaction ability, and self-development of students. The activities are often designed with rules that limit the communication channels of participants, requiring them to observe their surroundings and empathize with the people around them. However, the effects of the activities decrease when the situation becomes disordered. The facilitator must therefore be proficiently equipped with knowledge and skills to guide participants through the activities and reflect on the problem-solving process to communicate the themes of the activities. The observation duty of the facilitator is critical because one teacher can lead up to 30 participants at a time. Key actions, communication processes, and events must be recorded in a short time. Some adventure education activities are difficult to practice because of poor weather conditions, outsized equipment, or dangerous scenarios. Therefore, digital games were developed in this study to create simulated scenarios through which players can experience activities that are seldom performed. Digital games have been used for learning in various fields. As technology and creativity have advanced, game types and interface designs have changed substantially. Games can be played using keyboards, mouse, and remote and motion sensors. Microsoft released a kinesthetic game console, Xbox Kinect, which revolutionized the control rules of traditional games. Motion-sensing technology can detect and position the movement of players so that they can operate the game system directly without physical contact. Instead of a handheld or stampede controller, players use voice commands or physical gestures. A built-in camera is used to capture the movements of a player in a 3D space, thus enabling intuitive interaction with the characters and objects in the game. Virtual reality provides players with a sense of novelty, increasing their motivation to learn. This study involved using an Xbox Kinect and Unity 3D game engine to develop two multiplayer adventure education games. The games addressed cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral aspects of learning. The games were developed based on adventure education activities to enable participants to enhance their interpersonal relationships through group interaction. The digital games emphasized learning processes that involved user-initiated control, enabling users to construct situations that fit their intrinsic cognitions, thus improving their learning effectiveness. The participants enhanced their learning and problem-solving capabilities in the process (Perry, 1998). Through the postgame reflections, the participants were guided in perceiving their roles in the group, understanding the mechanism of leadership, and collaboratively solving problems. The collaborative gaming processes were recorded using computers, and researchers conducted observations. Questionnaires were used to cross-analyze the achievements of the participants based on adventure education themes, which was the primary goal of this study. Literature review Adventure education Adventure education is an experiential learning process in which people construct knowledge through direct experience, practicing skills, and strengthening values. Kolb (1984) defined learning as the process of transferring experience to knowledge. \u2026", "year": 2016}

We found that walking is the most common form of PA in the target users and they have an affinity to using technology devices. These insights led us to design the Puzzle Walk app that incorporates behavior change techniques (BCTs) (e.g., user instruction, self-monitoring, visual rewards, feedback on performance, and goal-setting).

Adaptive learning environments, which customize educational content and strategies to individual learners, offer a promising approach. Personalization within adaptive learning environments is crucial for addressing learner diversity and maximizing engagement and learning outcomes. This research project aims to explore the role of personalization in adaptive learning environments and its impact on the user experience and educational outcomes. By investigating the effectiveness of personalized interfaces and adaptive strategies, we seek to understand how these technologies can create more engaging and effective learning environments. The project objectives are threefold. Firstly, we aim to design and implement adaptive learning interfaces with personalized elements to customize the learning experience for each user. Secondly, we will evaluate the impact of personalization on user experience dimensions, including engagement, satisfaction, and motivation. Lastly, we will assess the effect of personalization on learning outcomes, such as knowledge acquisition and retention. This research contributes to the field of educational technology and user experience (UX) design. By examining the role of personalization in adaptive learning environments, we aim to inform the development of more effective and learner-centered educational tools and strategies.", "year": 2023}

The impact of pictures and calorie information on consumer behavior", "abstract": "PurposeThe study's purpose was to examine the role of two main factors in the design of online food delivery systems (OFDS) user interfaces: the display of pictures and calories \u2013 on consumers' attitudes toward online food delivery systems, intentions to use such systems, spending on a food item and tipping behavior.Design/methodology/approachThe study is grounded in the elaboration likelihood model. A 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 randomized post-test only between-subjects experimental design manipulated the types of pictures (food item only vs consumers eating a food item) and calorie information display style (numbers vs activity symbols) to determine whether they influence consumers' attitudes, intentions to purchase, spending and tipping behaviors.FindingsThe results show that the calorie display style influences consumers' intentions to use such systems and consumers' tipping behaviors toward the delivery driver. It was also found that the type of picture shown to consumers influences their intentions to purchase through ODFS, such that pictures of consumers enjoying a product is more effective in stimulating intentions to purchase than pictures containing only the food items.Research limitations/implicationsThis study advances the current knowledge on web design for restaurants wishing to distribute via online food delivery systems. Moreover, this study extends the literature on persuasion in online environments by focusing on foodservice \u2013 an area that only recently has undergone substantial distribution online. Finally, this study advances the literature on tipping behavior.Practical implicationsThis study provides several contributions for both restaurants and online food delivery system designers. Specifically, it illustrates exactly how specific elements in the design of the web interface and the message targeted at consumers influence consumers' behavior. Most importantly, this study provides insight into tipping behaviors for the delivery driver. This is important because the delivery driver is an important participant in the new value chain of restaurant delivery.Originality/valueAs the first study to develop an experiment that tests these important design conditions, this study offers several critical theoretical and practical implications. This study is the first attempt to examine various ways to present persuasive information in an OFDS in order to stimulate consumers' behaviors. Moreover, this study illustrates that the use of website design that enhance social presence is critical to website effectiveness in OFDS.", "year": 2020}

Typically analyzed by a specialist, the processing of the images is quite slow, consisting on the manual marking of features of interest in the retina, including the determination of the position and thickness of its different layers. This process is not consistent, the results are dependent on the clinician perception and do not take advantage of the technology, since the volumetric information that it currently provides is ignored. Therefore is of medical and technological interest to make a three-dimensional and automatic processing of images resulting from OCT technology. Only then we will be able to collect all the information that these images can give us and thus improve the diagnosis and early detection of eye pathologies. In addition to the 3D analysis, it is also important to develop visualization tools for the 3D data. This thesis proposes to apply 3D graphical processing methods to SD-OCT retinal images, in order to segment retinal layers. Also, to analyze the 3D retinal images and the segmentation results, a visualization interface that allows displaying images in 3D and from different perspectives is proposed. The work was based on the use of the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK), which includes other open-source toolkits. For this study a public database of SD-OCT retinal images will be used, containing about 360 volumetric images of healthy and pathological subjects. The software prototype allows the user to interact with the images, apply 3D filters for segmentation and noise reduction and render the volume. The detection of three surfaces of the retina is achieved through intensity-based edge detection methods with a mean error in the overall retina thickness of 3.72\u00b1 0.3 pixels.", "year": 2016}
{"paperId": "9da8e3243b140dfb9579862dbb0c4edf846a01ff", "title": "Grand challenges for HCI researchers", "abstract": "The remarkable impact of human-computer interaction research and user experience design compels researchers, practitioners, and journalists to ask: What is the next big thing? Therefore, it may be useful for our community to lay out grand challenges that steer the direction of future research, design, and commercial development. As HCI researchers, we are profoundly aware of the immense problems of our age: Growing human populations consume natural resources, flourishing cities require housing and transportation, families demand education and safety, and rising expectations from patients put pressure on healthcare and social systems. National priorities include economic development, political participation, civil rights, and achieving the delicate balance between appropriate security and excessive surveillance while pursuing open government policies that limit corruption and prevent waste. The U.S. National Academy of Engineering\u2019s Grand Challenges [1] provide a thoughtful list and international efforts such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals [2] suggest additional challenges. While addressing these problems, researchers, designers, and developers who recognize the aspirations of individuals, their desire for selfdetermination, and their hopes to contribute to their communities are more likely to deliver constructive products and services. These forward-looking innovators will manifest their sensitivity to individual and community norms, respect individual differences, and observe ethical codes of conduct. With these considerations in mind, the authors of Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction (6th Ed) [3] described 16 grand challenges for researchers, designers, and developers: 1. Develop a handbook of human needs. Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs from the 1940s provides some guidance, establishing a foundation of survival and safety, embracing love and esteem, and supporting self-actualization that realizes personal potentials. However, a contemporary and detailed handbook of human needs would help in the refining of designs and invention of new tools or services. 2. Shift from user experience to community experience. User experience designers have cleverly invented interfaces and processes that support work, communication, and fun. Now there is an opportunity to shift to community experience design, social media participation, game theoretic mechanisms, and motivational strategies to engage growing communities in constructive ways. Successful examples, such as Wikipedia or citizen science projects, show what is possible, but the common outcome of community experience design is insufficient response, raising the question of how to make more consistently successful outcomes. This shift is mirrored in the theory shift from emphasis on micro-HCI to macro-HCI. 3. Refine theories of persuasion. Theories of persuasion could lead to more rapid progress in smoking cessation, obesity reduction, medication compliance, and cancer prevention. A periodic table of persuasion strategies would chart the micro-structure of motivation for designers who create applications for individuals, friends and family, colleagues and neighbors, and citizens and markets. 4. Encourage resource conservation. The needs of a growing population will have to be trimmed by efficient strategies for reducing the use of water, energy, and natural resources while increasing production from renewable sources. User interfaces and community engagement will play key roles in providing feedback that encourages winning strategies. 5. Shape the learning health system. A grand opportunity for HCI researchers and designers is to help shape massive healthcare systems that support patients seeking wellness, clinicians delivering care, and providers eager to reduce costs while increasing the quality of care. Macro-HCI thinking and big data analytic tools could provide insights at every level that could be shared with relevant stakeholders, but producing meaningful changes in such massive systems remains a challenge. Bottomup strategies could propel patient and clinician participation, while top-down governance is needed to set policies, cope with malicious actors, and guide continuous improvement. 6. Advance the design of medical devices. Researchers have been rapidly developing medical devices that go far beyond current hearing aids, pacemakers, body sensors, and datarecording tools. As implanted insulin pumps, vision-restoration systems, prosthetic limbs, brain-computer interfaces, and nanodevices mature, user interfaces to monitor performance, log activity, and enable appropriate controls will be required. 7. Support successful aging strategies. The growing population of older adults want to maintain their health and independence while aging in place. They could benefit from interfaces that collect data from sensors, encourage healthy diet and exercise, promote social connectedness, and enable balanced involvement from caregivers. How might the growing Internet of Things help older adults improve quality of life?", "year": 2016}

{"paperId": "9f60b8a7e9dadf2290f96b646826f31404e9ca00", "title": "Gaze estimation and interaction in real-world environments", "abstract": "Human eye gaze has been widely used in human-computer interaction, as it is a promising modality for natural, fast, pervasive, and non-verbal interaction between humans and computers. Gaze information can either be used as explicit input to interactive systems or analysed over time to recognise user activity and cognitive states. As the foundation of gaze-related interactions, gaze estimation has been a hot research topic in recent decades. Dominant traditional gaze estimation methods require dedicated hardware including high-resolution cameras and additional infrared light sources to detect eye features, such as the pupil centre and iris boundary. Such dedicated hardware results in extra costs that can be very expensive, constrained head movement due to narrow field of view of the camera, limited distance between user and camera to capture high-resolution images, and sensitivity to illumination conditions as sunlight will interfere with infrared light sources. Consequently, most gaze-based interaction researchers conducted their studies in settings in which lighting, user position, etc. can be controlled. In contrast, appearance-based gaze estimation methods directly regress from eye images to gaze targets without eye feature detection, and therefore have great potential to work with ordinary devices, such as a cellphone, tablet, laptop, or public display. However, these methods require a large amount of domain-specific training data to cover the significant variability in eye appearance. Unfortunately, most of the previous gaze estimation datasets were collected under laboratory conditions, and thus we cannot properly study the capabilities of appearance-based methods for interactive applications in practice. In this thesis, we focus on developing appearance-based gaze estimation methods and corresponding attentive user interfaces with a single webcam for challenging real-world environments. First, we collect a large-scale gaze estimation dataset, MPIIGaze, the first of its kind, outside of controlled laboratory conditions. This dataset enables us, for the first time, to conduct cross-dataset evaluation as training and test on different datasets to study the generalisation capabilities of appearancebased methods in real-world settings. To fully utilise the large amount of data, we the propose GazeNet method, which uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the first time for the gaze estimation task, and achieves significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Second, we propose an appearance-based method that, in stark contrast to a long-standing tradition in gaze estimation, only takes the full face image as input. The face patch has been used in recent work as part of the input. However, it is still an open question whether there is additional information in the other regions of the face, and how to efficiently encode this. We investigate the single full-face approach for 2D and 3D appearance-based gaze estimation and improve the model", "year": 2018}

The world-in-miniature (WIM) navigation metaphor allows users to travel in large-scale virtual environments (VEs) regardless of available physical space while maintaining a high-level overview of the VE. It relies on a hand-held, scaled-down duplicate of the entire VE, where the user\u2019s current position is displayed, and an interface provided to introduce his/her next movements [17]. There are several extensions to deal with challenges of this navigation technique, e.g. scaling and scrolling [23]. In this work, a WIM is presented that integrates state-of-the-art research insights and incorporates additional features that became apparent during the integration process. These features are needed to improve user interactions and to provide both look-ahead and post-travel feedback. For instance, a novel occlusion handling feature hides the WIM geometry in a rounded space reaching from the user\u2019s hand to his/her forearm. This allows the user to interact with occluded areas of the WIM such as buildings. Further extensions include different visualizations for occlusion handling, an interactive preview screen, post-travel feedback, automatic WIM customization, a unified diegetic UI design concerning WIM and user representation, and an adaptation of widely established gestures to control scaling and scrolling of the WIM. Overall, the presented WIM design integrates and extends state-of-the-art interaction tasks and visualization concepts to overcome open conceptual gaps and to provide a comprehensive practical solution for traveling in VR.", "year": 2020}

The projector displays a rendered virtual scene on a flat 2D surface (floor or table) based on the user\u2019s viewpoint to create a head coupled perspective. The projected image is view-dependent which changes and deforms relative to user\u2019s position in space. The nature of perspective projection is distorted and anamorphic such that the deformations in the image give an illusion of a virtual three dimensional holographic scene in which the objects are popping out or floating above the projection plane like real 3D objects. Also, the user can manipulate and interact with 3D objects in a virtual environment by controlling the position and orientation of 3D models, interacting with GUI incorporated in virtual scene and can view, move, manipulate and observe the details of objects from any angle naturally by using his hands. The head and hand tracking is achieved by a low cost 3D depth sensor \u2018Kinect\u2019. We describe the implementation of the system in OpenGL and Unity3D game engine. Stereoscopic 3D along with other enhancements are also introduced which further improves the 3D perception.

A generous interface was deemed appropriate for displaying large amounts of digital cultural heritage. However, more example verification is required in this field of study. This study compared the traditional interface and the generous interface of the Liaoning Provincial Museum to investigate the role of a generous interface for cultural heritage collections. Forty second\u2010year design graduate students were randomly assigned to one of two interface groups: traditional interface or generous interface. Four variables were measured to compare the differences between the two interfaces for the participants. In addition, two parameters, holding time and average retrieval time, are recorded and used to evaluate and compare the impact of the two interfaces on user behavior. The generous interface, according to the findings, is more effective than the traditional interface in increasing participants' engagement with cultural heritage and is perceived to be more aesthetically pleasing. In addition, the generous interface has been proven to be more suitable for casual leisure users to explore cultural heritage information.

The areas of application for these technologies have mostly been in gaming and entertainment. However, in professional environments, there are especially demanding tasks that would greatly benefit from improved human machine interfaces as well as an overall improved user experience. We, therefore, envisioned and built an image-interpretation-workstation of the future, a multi-monitor workplace comprised of four screens. Each screen is dedicated to a complex software product such as a geo-information system to provide geographic context, an image annotation tool, software to generate standardized reports and a tool to aid in the identification of objects. Using self-developed systems for hand tracking, pointing gestures and head pose estimation in addition to touchscreens, face identification, and speech recognition systems we created a novel approach to this complex task. For example, head pose information is used to save the position of the mouse cursor on the currently focused screen and to restore it as soon as the same screen is focused again while hand gestures allow for intuitive manipulation of 3d objects in mid-air. While the primary focus is on the task of image interpretation, all of the technologies involved provide generic ways of efficiently interacting with a multi-screen setup and could be utilized in other fields as well. In preliminary experiments, we received promising feedback from users in the military and started to tailor the functionality to their needs", "year": 2016}

They tend to gift a unique multilayered conveyance knowledge cloud platform by exploitation cloud computing and IoT technologies to resolve the challenges caused by the increasing transportation issues. They present a novel multilayered vehicular data cloud platform by using cloud computing and IoT technologies. Two innovative vehicular data cloud services, an intelligent parking cloud service and a vehicular data mining cloud service in the IoT environment are also presented reviews. Amir-Mohammad Rahmani, Nanda Kumar Thanigaivelan, Tuan Nguyen Gia, Jose Granados, Behailu Negash, Pasi Liljeberg, and Hannu Tenhunen [2] proposes the strategic position of gateways to offer several higherlevel services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. Michele Nitti, Luigi Atzori, and Irena Pletikosa Cvijikj [3] addressed the issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability.They first propose five heuristics, which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure.

[5] proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, they propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over lowpower wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network International Conference on Science and Engineering for Sustainable Development (ICSESD-2017) (www.jit.org.in) International Journal of Advanced Engineering, Management and Science (IJAEMS) Special Issue-1 https://dx.doi.org/10.24001/icsesd2017.49 ISSN : 2454-1311 www.ijaems.com Page | 195 infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. Al-Fuqaha, A., Kalamazoo, MI, Guizani, M. , Mohammadi, M., Aledhari, M.

Moreover, they explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. They also presents the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Stecca, M., Moiso, C., Fornasa, M., Baglietto, P. [7] presents app execution platform (AEP), a platform that supports the design, deployment, execution, and management of IoT applications in the domain of smart home, smart car, and smart city. AEP was designed to coherently fulfill a set of requirements covered only partially or in a fragmented way by other IoT application platforms. AEP focuses on SO virtualization and on composite application (CA) orchestration and supports dynamic object availability. Yi-Bing Lin, Yun-Wei Lin, Chang-Yen Chih, Tzu-Yi Li [8] proposes an IoT device which is characterized by its \u201cfeatures\u201d (e.g., temperature, vibration, and display) that are manipulated by the network applications. If a network application handles the individual device features independently, then we can write a software module for each device feature, and the network application can be simply constructed by including these brick-like device feature modules. Based on the concept of device feature, brick-like software modules can provide simple and efficient mechanism to develop IoT device applications and interactions. Ganz, F. , Puschmann, D. , Barnaghi, P. , Carrez, F.

Moreover, we utilize the provided context to assign the generated profiles to more contextually complex activities. This methodology is being evaluated into an AAL structure equipped with several sensors. More precisely, they assess the proposed method in a data set generated by accelerometers and its performance over a number of everyday activities Mainetti, L., Lecce, Mighali, V. ; Patrono, L. [12] proposes a software architecture to easily mash-up constrained application protocol (CoAP) resources. It is able to discover the available devices and to virtualize them outside the physical network. These virtualizations are then exposed to the upper layers by a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface, so that the physical devices interact only with their own virtualization. Furthermore, the system provides simplified tools allowing the development of mash-up applications to different-skilled users. Finally, the architecture allows not only to monitor but also to control the devices, thus establishing a bidirectional communication channel. Hasan Omar Al-Sakran [13] presents a novel intelligent traffic administration system, based on Internet of Things, which is featured by low cost, high scalability, high compatibility, easy to upgrade, to replace traditional traffic management system and the proposed system can improve road traffic tremendously.

This book discusses such issues, focusing upon the human element of VR rather than technical implementation, for if we do not get the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool confined to research laboratories. Even when VR principles are fully understood, first implementations are rarely novel and never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities. However, the VR principles discussed within enable us to intelligently experiment with the rules and iteratively design towards innovative experiences. Digital Cultures, Lived Stories and Virtual Reality Data will not help you if you can\u2019t see it where you need it. Or can\u2019t collect it where you need it. Upon these principles, wearable technology was born. And although smart watches and fitness trackers have become almost ubiquitous, with in-body sensors on the horizon, the future applications of wearable computers hold so much more. A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied. Upon its initial publication, the first edition almost instantly became a trusted reference, setting the stage for the coming decade, in which the explosion in research and applications of wearable computers and augmented reality occurred. Written by expert researchers and teachers, each chapter in the second edition has been revised and updated to reflect advances in the field and provide fundamental knowledge on each topic, solidifying the book\u2019s reputation as a valuable technical resource as well as a textbook for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing courses. New Chapters in the Second Edition Explore: Haptics Visual displays Use of augmented reality for surgery and manufacturing Technical issues of image registration and tracking Augmenting the environment with wearable audio interfaces Use of augmented reality in preserving cultural heritage Human-computer interaction and augmented reality technology Spatialized sound and augmented reality Augmented reality and robotics Computational clothing From a technology perspective, much of what is happening now with wearables and augmented reality would not have been possible even five years ago. In the fourteen years since the first edition burst on the scene, the capabilities and applications of both technologies are orders of magnitude faster, smaller, and cheaper. Yet the book\u2019s overarching mission remains the same: to supply the fundamental information and basic knowledge about the design and use of The New Digital Storytelling This book brings fantasy storytelling to a whole new level by providing an in-depth insight into the tools used for virtual reality, augmented reality, 360 cinema and motion capture in order to repurpose them to create a virtual studio for filmmaking. Gone are the long days and months of post before seeing your final product. Composites and CG characters can now be shot together as fast as a live-action show. Using off-the-shelf software and tools, authors Mark Sawicki and Juniko Moody document the set-up and production pipelines of the modern virtual/mocap studio. They reveal the procedures and secrets for making movies in virtual sets. The high-end technology that enabled the creation of films such as The Lord of the Rings, Avatar and The Jungle Book is now accessible for smaller, independent production companies. Do you want your actors to perform inside of an Unreal\u00ae Game Engine set and interact with the environment? Do you want to be able to put your live-action camera on a jib or dolly and move effortlessly through both a live-action and virtual space together? Do you want live performers interacting with giants, elves and other creatures manipulated by motion capture in real time? This book discusses all of these scenarios and more, showing readers how to create high-quality virtual content using alternative, cost-effective technology. Tutorials, case studies, and project breakdowns provide essential tips on how to avoid and overcome common pitfalls, making this book an indispensable guide for both beginners to create virtual backlot content and more advanced VFX users wanting to adopt best practices when planning and directing virtual productions with RealityTM software and performance capture equipment such as Qualysis. The 360\u00b0 Video Handbook Creators of immersive experiences in virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality have relied heavily on familiar storytelling techniques used in books, theatre, and film -- often with confusing and unengaging results. Stephanie Riggs argues in The End of Storytelling that in order to develop powerful stories in these emerging mediums, we need nothing short of a paradigm shift in how we approach and conceptualize immersive narratives. Beautifully designed and explosively written, this book will help you better understand how to approach the exciting medium and get your next immersive project off the ground by explaining: Why storytelling doesn't work The fundamental narrative building blocks that do work How to think immersively A blueprint for developing your next immersive project The End of Storytelling is informed by over two decades of work in both immersive and classical mediums, and is rich with examples, inspiration, and challenges for anyone interested in, or currently developing, effective immersive experiences. Its symphonic exploration presents fascinating context of our relationship to storytelling, and a practical model for building the future of narrative.

However, the design of GUIs has mostly been a manual activity. To design a GUI, the designer must select its visual, spatial, textual, and interaction properties such that the combination strikes a balance among the relevant human factors. While emerging computational-design techniques have addressed some problems related to grid layouts, no general approach has been proposed that can also produce good and complete results covering color-related decisions and other nonlinear design objectives. Evolutionary algorithms are promising and demonstrate good handling of similar problems in other conditions, genetic operators, depending on how they are designed. But even these approaches struggle with elements' overlap and hence produce too many infeasible candidate solutions. This paper presents a new approach based on grid-based genetic operators demonstrated in a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) setting. The operators use grid lines for element positions in a novel manner to satisfy overlap-related constraints and intrinsically improve the alignment of elements. This approach can be used for crossovers and mutations. Its core benefit is that all the solutions generated satisfy the no-overlap requirement and represent well-formed layouts. The new operators permit using genetic algorithms for increasingly realistic task instances, responding to more design objectives than could be considered before. Specifically, we address grid quality, alignment, selection time, clutter minimization, saliency control, color harmony, and grouping of elements.", "year": 2021}

However, there are barriers to CPG utilization such as lack of awareness and lack of familiarity of the CPGs by clinicians due to ineffective CPG dissemination and implementation. This calls for research into effective and scalable CPG dissemination strategies that will improve CPG awareness and familiarity. We describe a formal model-driven approach to design and implement a gamified e-learning system for clinical guidelines. We employ gamification to increase user motivation and engagement in the training of guideline content. Our approach involves the use of models for different aspects of the system, an entity model for the clinical domain, a workflow model for the clinical processes and a game model to manage the training sessions. A game engine instantiates a training session by coupling the workflow and entity models to automatically generate questions based on the data in the model instances.

As part of an active learning pedagogy, students in the author\u2019s sections of the course were clustered into teams that designed and played games on refugee migration, aid, and resettlement. Students in seminar sections taught by other faculty members experienced traditional forms of instruction that did not include game design. Data from a survey administered to students in different seminar sections did not indicate an association between game design and student engagement. Further investigation revealed substantial declines in the results of student evaluations of the author\u2019s teaching from the previous year, despite only minor differences in course content. Colleagues anecdotally reported a marked decrease in the academic orientation and performance of first-year students in 2017, suggesting that pre-existing characteristics may be a greater influence on student engagement than an active learning pedagogy involving games. The Active Learning Pedagogy Games and simulations exemplify an active learning instructional methodology. The rationale for their use as teaching tools starts with the premise that they actively engage students in the direct experience of a lived reality, an environment that allows for efficient comprehension of complex knowledge and development of skills. This environment is believed to facilitate learning because it permits rapid and continuous empirical observation, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing (Enterline and Jepsen 2009, 58). Traditional pedagogies, in contrast, require that students passively receive information from teachers, work to understand it, and then, after some delay, attempt to correctly apply it. When a delay exists between encountering knowledge and the opportunity to apply it, it is believed to become less relevant to the learner, resulting in decreased interest and less learning (Dorn 1989, 6). Although active learning seems to have several advantages over traditional teaching methods, its effectiveness is not as clear as is generally assumed. Andrews et al. (2011, 394) found \u201cno association between student learning gains and the use of active-learning instruction\u201d in college biology courses. Meta-analyses of problem-based learning, an active learning methodology frequently used in medical education, found no evidence that it contributed to superior performance on standardized exams (Gijbels et al. 2005, 31-32). In an introductory statistics course, students who experienced the active learning method of a flipped classroom were less satisfied with how the technique \u201coriented them to the learning tasks in the course\u201d (Strayer 2012, 171). Cobb (2016, 13) found no difference in student performance across traditional, flipped, and online versions of an American government course. In a review of literature on the use of active learning techniques in the political science classroom, Ishiyama (2013, 124) found \u201cremarkably little empirical evidence . . . in the top SOTL journals in US political science and international relations that demonstrates such techniques are effective in promoting student learning.\u201d Teaching With Gaming and Simulation Reported benefits of games and simulations include improvements in students\u2019 domain knowledge, analytical thinking skills, and exam scores (Shellman and Turan 2006, 30; Frederking 2005, 391; Baranowski 2006, 40); their intellectual and emotional engagement (Weidenfeld and Fernandez 2017, 54; Crocco, Offenholley, and Hernandez 2016, 418); their desire to learn about the practices and beliefs of different ethno-cultural groups (Sales et al. 2013, 3); and their empathy toward others (Cruz and Patterson 2005, 43; Chen et al. 2015, 3; Zappile, Beers, and Raymond 2017, 11). A study by Crocco et al. (2016, 419) found that games were \u201cmost effective when used to foster higher-order thinking, such as application, analysis, and evaluation.\u201d In a meta-analysis of published literature, Baranowski and Weir (2015, 399) concluded that \u201ca small but growing body of evidence lends support to the contention that students who participate in simulations do in fact learn more than students not taking part in such exercises.\u201d However, other studies have not replicated these findings. Raymond (2010, 57) found that no statistically significant improvements in exam scores among students who participated in a simulation, while Powner and Allendoerfer (2008, 85) concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in the overall performance of students who participated in either a role-play activity or classroom discussion. I became interested in whether the design of games by students, in contrast to only gameplay, might have a positive effect on students\u2019 engagement with a course\u2019s academic content. A review of the literature produced only one journal article on the subject, \u201cWhat Happens When Students Design and Run Their Own Simulations?\u201d by Ken Jones, published in 1998 in Simulation & Gaming. In the article, Jones presents a classroom exercise in which groups of students designed simulations by answering four questions: \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem (or issue, or situation)? Who are the participants (roles, duties)? What do they have to do (talk, plan, negotiate)? What do they have to do it with (previous knowledge, documents, match-sticks)?\u201d (Jones 1998, 393). Jones focuses the exercise\u2019s ability to \u201cconfer power to the participants\u201d and \u201cencourage teachers to share power and responsibility\u201d (Jones 1998, 342). He does not discuss the activity\u2019s usefulness in achieving specific cognitive or affective outcomes. The Course I decided to test my hypothesis that game design might improve student engagement in UNV 101 University Seminar I, a three-credit course taken in the first college semester by all entering undergraduates at my university. Launched in Fall 2014 as a part of a revision to the university\u2019s general education requirements, its stated purpose to provide students with an opportunity to \u201cbegin to develop college-level analytical and communication skills to prepare them for academic success\u201d (Salve Regina University 2017). Specific course content is left up to the instructor. I have taught UNV 101 since its inception and emphasize three of the student learning outcomes in the university\u2019s general education curriculum (Salve Regina University Core Curriculum Task Force 2013): \uf0b7 Speak and write about significant issues in a cogent, analytical and persuasive manner. \uf0b7 Analyze and evaluate the interaction among diverse populations around the world and within the United States. \uf0b7 Demonstrate awareness of the challenges facing society and of the need for merciful and just responses to them. This last learning outcome provided me with a justification for building a critical, social justice-oriented agenda into UNV 101 in 2016. The study of refugees and immigration\u2014a topic made all the more relevant by the outcome of that year\u2019s U.S. presidential election\u2014acting as a framework for this agenda. My intent was not to organize the course around the traditional assessment of students\u2019 recall of factual or conceptual knowledge, but to \u201cinspire the adoption of new frames for understanding and, possibly, changing the world\u201d (Barab et al. 2007, 266). My hope was to introduce students to alternative modes of thinking about people who are frequently disparaged and mistreated. Multi-week, collaborative game design projects served as an instrument for implementing this agenda in 2016 and 2017. These projects involved students in design thinking, an iterative, feedback-driven process of problem definition, understanding the complexity and uncertainty of systems, decision making, and teamwork. Design thinking, when embedded in a project-based learning environment, emphasizes the application of knowledge as a means of making the problem at hand understandable (Dym et al. 2005, 104-105; Gaydos 2015, 478). Games happen to represent aspects of design thinking in a manner that is easy for students to comprehend. For example, any game reflects a set of deliberate choices made by the designer that were intended to benefit the game\u2019s end users. Games also illustrates the principle that the suitability of a solution often depends on the context of the problem. \u201c[A] game that succeeds in one environment may not succeed in another\u201d (Crocco et al. 2016, 407). During the semester, students in my UNV 101 section participated in three game design projects. Each project included a preparatory memo-writing assignment to familiarize students with the game\u2019s real-world context, a game design and construction phase, play-testing of the completed game by another team of students who scored it against a rubric of design criteria, and a performance evaluation in which students ranked the contributions to the project of all team members. The memo, rubric score, and performance evaluation all contributed to students\u2019 final course grades. For each project, I provided students with a problem definition of the game they were about to design, specifying the role assumed by the game\u2019s players, the game\u2019s setting, and its educational objectives. The problem definition for the first game, which placed players in the role of a young South Sudanese woman who flees her village and becomes a refugee, is contained in Appendix A. In the second game, players acted as members of a humanitarian aid organization that constructed and operated a camp for Rohingya refugees in Thailand. For the third game, players decided how a community in the U.S. could best assimilate a group of resettled refugees from Afghanistan. Collectively the three projects represented approximately twenty-five percent of the final course grade. In Fall 2017, students also completed twenty-three written responses to readings, worth fifty-seven percent of the final course grade. Another portion of the c", "year": 2018}

In order to control the micro rotor-craft flight attitude by hand gestures, we obtain the hand palm flat attitude data by Leap Motion controller,and transform the data into rotor-craft attitude controlling orders between different coordinate system by coordinate system transformation and attitude angle transformation, and communicate with the micro rotor-craft by wireless transmission module.We build up a micro rotor-craft controlling system, and achieve controlling the flight actions including rising,hovering, landing, pitch and etc. by different hand gestures in real experiments.Controlling micro rotor-craft by hand gestures matches the features of natural interaction more,and it is an extension of man-machine interaction. Introduction Gesture recognition control is a kind of Natural User Interfaces(NUIs)[1] way. Compared with the other somatosensory interaction, gesture recognition has advantages in the natural interactive experience, rich information, high efficiency and low energy consumption. With the development of computer technology and intelligent sensor technology, the accuracy of gesture recognition has been gradually improved, and the price of hardware equipment has gradually decreased, the gesture recognition has been an important development direction of human-computer interaction. The gesture recognition hardware can be divided into two types: Wearable recognition device and optical recognition device. With the gradually developing of technology,optical recognition device identification accuracy is relatively high with low price and friendly interaction experience. Leap motion controller(hereinafter referred as Leap Motion) is one kind of excellent optical recognition equipment[2]. Joanna C. Coelho et.al. built a virtual environment, and compare Leap Motion with traditional mouse in clicking mission on single point[3]. Lamtharn Hantrakul has used Leap Motion in audio synthesis software and interactive manipulation of real-time performance[4]. D. Bassily et al. use Leap Motion to carry out the matching test of the self-adaptable mechanical arm in order to design the remote machine control system and assisted living system for the old[5]. Boyali Ali et al. use Leap Motion to control the wheelchair to move in a complex environment[6]. In this study, a method of using gesture recognition to control a micro rotor aircraft[7] is came out and with the combination of natural interaction, the micro rotor aircraft flight attitude control technology is certificated by real experiments. System Design The general goal of the system is to use the hand palm plane to simulate the body plane of the aircraft in-flight. By changing the palm attitude, the aircraft flight motion(e.g. rising, landing, pitch etc.) changes accordingly. The whole system includes following four modules: gesture capture module, data processing module, wireless communication module, and micro rotor aircraft module. The overall framework of the system is shown in Fig. 1. 2nd International Conference on Machinery, Materials Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology (MMECEB 2015) \u00a9 2016.

Coordinate system transformation Gesture capture module: The Leap Motion is used as a gesture data capture sensor, which is one of the desktop level optical hand gesture recognition equipment with low identification error and high frame per second(FPS)[8]. In this research, the Leap Motion is used to record the position and Euler angle of palm in real-time and transmitted it to the data processing module;Data processing module:it is a PC which communicates with Leap Motion through USB interface. This module is to deal with the original data by corresponding transformation,generate flight orders,and send to the communication module; Communication module:it is used for sending orders and receiving real-time on-board sensor data of aircraft by wireless transmission. In this research, a Crazyradio PA is used. The device uses a ISM 2.4GHz band radio signal, sending and receiving data packets; Micro rotor aircraft module: This is the final module of gesture control system. In this research, a Crazyflie 2 micro rotor aircraft(hereinafter referred as Crazyflie 2) is used, which is open source, easy maintenance and small size(99mm*99mm with the weight of 28.5g). The on-board single chip microcomputer sends the on-board sensors flight data to the communication module and processing errors between orders and sensors data. Key problems and realization Coordinate system transformation The Leap Motion coordinate system is different to the Crazyflie 2 flight coordinate system, and the definitions of the Euler angles are different either.In order to realize the system gesture interaction, it needs to establish the transformation between the two different coordinate systems. As shown in Fig. 2, according to right hand rule,the Leap Motion coordinate system firstly rotated 90 degree around the Y axis, and then rotated -90 degree around the X axis to get the Crazyflie 2 coordinate system.

Duke Herrell Departments of Urology and Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University Medical Center Introduction: While many consider transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) the gold standard treatment for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), recent evidence has shown that holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is at least as effective as TURP, with less perioperative morbidity including shorter length of catheter use, lower transfusion rates, and shorter hospital stay. Despite the advantages of HoLEP, there has been reluctance of the urologic community to adopt the procedure, primarily as a result of a perceived steep learning curve. Thus, we sought to design and develop a novel transurethral endoscopic robotic platform for HoLEP. Methods: An intensive clinical collaboration between Vanderbilt engineers and urologists was undertaken to develop a handheld robot that passes through a standard endoscope with the specific goal of improving the ease with which HoLEP is able to be performed. Results: The robotic system design consists of 3 main modules: the user interface, the transmission, and the endoscope (Figure 1). The user interface consists of 2 handles, each with an embedded joystick and trigger which are linked to motors responsible for driving the concentric tube manipulators. The transmission section converts the motion of the motors into translation and rotation of the tubes. The endoscope contains optics, inflow/outflow channels, and a 5mm working channel through which 2 concentric tube robots are passed. Each concentric tube consists of a straight outer tube and superelastic nitinol inner tube that is preshaped into a curved configuration. When these tubes are translated and rotated, their elastic interaction creates a \u201ctentacle-like\u201d motion. The entire hand-held robot is mounted on a counterbalanced arm to allow for manual manipulation and positioning of the entire robot by the surgeon. Conclusions: We have developed a concentric tube robotic platform passed through a standard endoscope capable of producing complex movements of the end effectors. Through these motions, it possible to retract tissue with one arm and aim a laser with the other, thus alleviating one of the major challenges encountered during HoLEP.", "year": 2016}

Today in the 21st century, the world of advertising has become a very dynamic, creative and challenging place which tells us the story of product, evolution and its endless possibilities in the world which we live. We live in the world of advertisements. Advertising is a unique and powerful tool of communicating ideas, information integrating writing, mixed and remixed images, layout, sound, gesture, speech and 3D objects. Being on the internet can be a cost-effective way to attract new customers. You can reach a global audience at a low cost. Many customers research businesses online before deciding whom to buy from. A well-designed website can entice customers to buy from you. There are a number of ways you can promote your business online via paid advertising or to improve your search engine rankings. Learn more about doing business online. Other ways to advertise your business online include promoting your products or services on social media sites, blogs and search engines and other websites that your target audience visits. Most of the traditional paper ads are printing web addresses of advertisers for finding more information the prospective consumers require. Every ad has a website address posted to it. Online or web advertising can be defined as the promotion of products or services by advertising through the internet media. Online advertising is very interactive compared to the other forms of traditional advertising. The consumers can pick and choose the information, sales message and buying modes that fit their individual needs. Online advertising offer the best of push and pull advertising in which merchant can pull consumers in based on their advertising and material out to them once they have created a relationship because users select the sites they visit, advertisers are most guaranteed highly qualified purpose. With the advent of technology, the internet has positioned itself as one of the very few media alternatives that can be used for almost all advertising purpose across all possible market segments. The growing popularity of the internet and the mass media hype surrounding its commercial potential has triggered an avalanche of internet in using this new tool for marketing and advertising. In fact, the internet has taken only few years to achieve a critical mass of almost 50 million users. The radio, television and cable have taken a lot more years to achieve this number than the internet took. This suggests the rapid acceptance of the internet as a medium of connectivity and commerce. As the internet gained popularity, marketers began to explore if this medium was lucrative to advertise on and found that it give them more than what the other media could offer. The internet provided their customers with interactivity consumers could now interact with their product and build their own experience with it. The rate of technological change in the marketing environment is an important factor that influences the marketing success. The growth of the internet as a provider of standard global access to systems and networks all over the world is an area of huge interest currently and will very soon become a major consideration for the marketing departments of most Indian organization marketing to consumers and business. Internet advertising was essentially done through news groups, e-mail, insertions in newsletters and news and distributed via list servers. Literally thousands of internet sites serve niche audiences, enhancing the likelihood of reading people with an inherent internet in specific audiences. For advertisers that choose the right sites, there is less wasted than with traditional mass media, like television networks that seek massive heterogeneous audiences. Some online sites have amassed gigantic databases on consumers that enable advertisers to customers match their messages with likely consumers. Web advertising comes in many types with the ultimate objective of attracting of the browser.", "year": 2018}

To this end, numerous methods have been developed and investigated since the emergence of VR in order to improve the user experience for interactions such as gaming or text entry while wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) and using handheld controllers [1, 2]. Although several novel text entry methods have been proposed, there is little research comparing the methods using virtual keyboard interfaces evaluated as experimental conditions. This would allow for a more focused and specialized comparison.Statement of Objective:This work presents the design and empirical evaluation of a split and standard virtual keyboard for text input in virtual environments using handheld controllers. There are numerous applications, including games, for example, entering a gamer\u2019s name or messaging other gamers. An experimental evaluation of two virtual keyboards using VR handheld controllers will be conducted. (Note: As the experiment is ongoing, this abstract is written in the future tense. The final submission will transition to the past tense.) The focus will be on entry speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Both keyboards will be QWERTY-based, but with different organizations. Similar to most physical keyboards, the \u201cstandard\u201d keyboard will have all the keys in one arrangement. However, the \u201csplit\u201d keyboard will display keys in a split pattern on each side of the screen. For the standard keyboard, users will operate one handheld controller in their preferred hand. For the split keyboard, users will operate one controller in each hand. Thus, a significant point of comparison in the present research is one-handed input vs. two-handed input for the same task. Description of Methods:This research follows an experimental methodology. There will be a total of 14 participants recruited from the local university campus. The study will be a 2 \u00d7 5 within-subjects design with the following independent variables and levels:\u2022 Keyboard (standard one-handed, split two-handed)\u2022 Block (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)The order of testing the keyboards will be counterbalanced to offset learning effects.Five phrases of text will be entered for each block, with phrases selected at random from a standard phrase set [3]. Thus the total number of trials will be 14 participants x 2 keyboards x 5 blocks x 5 phrases/block = 700. The following are the dependent variables in the study:\u2022 Entry speed (wpm)\u2022 Error rate (%)\u2022 Keystroke per character (KSPC)The Unity 3D game engine is used to create the text-input interface installed on the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Participants will use the Meta Quest handheld controllers to input text. Input uses raycasting, in which the handheld controller casts a virtual line or ray. The virtual ray is positioned on a key on the virtual keyboard, wherein the user presses the trigger on the handheld controller to select the character indicated by the ray.Significance of the Proposed Presentation:The work is significant due to its presentation of the design and experimental evaluation of novel text entry input methods for virtual environments The work pushes the limits of contemporary devices (Meta Quest 2 VR headset) and platforms (Unity 3D game engine) into a design space of particular interest to research in virtual environments.Discussion of Results:Statistical tests, such as the analysis of variance, will be used to identify statistically significant differences between the keyboards for entry speed (wpm), error rate (%), and efficiency using KSPC. Tests for improvement in performance over the five blocks of testing will be included, as well. Regression models will be built using the power law of practice to model the pattern of learning over the blocks of testing. Design implications and suggestions will be offered, as will opportunities for future work. Full details are to be included in the final submission.", "year": 2023}

This has only become more urgent since the introduction of the FAIR principles which state that metadata should use controlled vocabularies and meet community standards. The iRODS data grid technology is well positioned as a core layer within an infrastructure to manage research data. One of its strengths is the ability to attach any number of attribute, value, unit (AVU) triples as metadata to any iRODS object. This makes iRODS adaptable to very diverse use cases in research data management. However, the challenge of working with more structured metadata is not being addressed by the default capabilities of iRODS. Our aim is to develop a new method for storing richer, templated and validated metadata in AVUs. JSON is a popular, \ufb02exible and easy to use format for serializing (nested) data, while maintaining human and developer readability. Furthermore, a JSON Schema can be used to validate a JSON structure and it can also be used to obtain a dynamically generated form on the basis of this schema. This combination of functionalities makes it an excellent format for metadata. We have therefore designed and implemented a bidirectional conversion between JSON and AVUs. The conversion method has been implemented as Python iRODS rules that allow to set and retrieve AVU metadata on an iRODS object using a JSON structure. Optionally, a policy can be installed to validate metadata entry and updates against the JSON Schema that governs the object. With this work we provide other iRODS developers with a generic method for conversion between JSON and AVUs. We are encouraging others to use the conversion method in their deployments.", "year": 2019}

More \nprecisely the task in which the project will focus will be to pick a certain soda can from a table \nwith several of them on it and pour its contents into a glass placed on another table for the user \nto have his/her drink.

This makes it possible \nto easily integrate them to other processes in order to complete other similar tasks, making the \npackages more versatile and adaptable. \nThe work has been divided between two master thesis projects. The first one focuses on developing the packages in charge of navigation and arm manipulation, which is reflected on this \nmemory. The second one, carried out by Miller Stiven Espinosa Munoz, covers the perception \nand task management blocks. \nFor the navigation part a solution has been implemented to map the environment and define \nall the necessary poses to complete the manipulation process.

In this way \nthe poses are defined with respect to these marks and linked to the map automatically. For \nnavigation itself the ROS 2D Navigation stack has been exploited to control the base and move it \nsuccessfully. \nFor the arm manipulation two different techniques, aside of the ones already built in the robot, \nhave been implemented. A technique based on generating trajectories using the geometric planner RRTConnect has been developed for the movements involved in picking the cans from the \ntable using the interface of The Kautham Project, a software for robot motion planning.

From configuration possibilities, over available digital functions, to interaction possibilities with the vehicle: the complexity of technology has been rising relentlessly \u2013 and more often than not, users are overwhelmed. At the same time, the importance of electric mobility is increasing. More and more people are driving electric vehicles or planning to do so. These drivers have specific needs (e.g. \u201cI need to charge my vehicle at home\u201d), fears (e.g. \u201cWill I be able to reach my destination with my current SoC?\u201d) and desires (e.g \u201cI want to get into a cool car, even in summer\u201d). On top of that other consumer goods and services such as phones, banking/payment processes or online shopping have fundamentally changed and shaped customer expectations: everything is connected, and so should vehicles be. The importance of technology has thus been increasing. However, betting on technology alone is not enough anymore. Indeed, the overall experience with a product or a service has become a significant feature for differentiation, for tech companies and automotive OEMs alike. We want to argue, that, for too long now, connected mobility and electric mobility have been considered in a too dissociated manner. The \u201cCASE\u201d acronym is the perfect example for this. Often used as key word to describe the new mobility transition, each letter, or aspect, is mostly presented on its own. This is also something one can witness in automotive companies, where there is an \u201cautonomous hub\u201d, and \u201celectric mobility department\u201d and a \u201cshared services branch\u201d. However, both topics, electric mobility and connectivity, could hugely benefit from each other, by being considered together. And the link to successfully combine these two, the key for improving products and services for the end users, is user experience.

Following, we will take a look at the current market and examine the needs of users when it comes to electric and connected mobility. Afterwards, we will dive into the current automotive market, presenting trends in e-mobility products, connected services and HMI-concepts and then we will show electric mobility and connectivity in vehicles share common challenges. Finally, and most importantly, we will show how these different aspects can be successfully combined, to create great products and services, using user experience methods and tools. We will particularly focus on one of our developed solutions, the \u201ceExperience Drive\u201d and show how this method can increase awareness and understanding of the customers\u2019 needs and how it can be integrated into the development process for electric and connected vehicles, to create a great and exciting user experience. 1. What is user experience and why is it so important? ` The international standard on ergonomics of human-system interaction (ISO 9241-210) defines user experience as \u201ca person\u2019s perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service\u201d [1]. This means that user experience encompasses all aspects of the end user\u2019s interaction with a service or a product, from the purchase or use intention, over the use itself, right up to the end of use of said product or service. Basically, we can thus split user experience into three parts: before \u2013 during \u2013 after the use of a product or service. If we abstract this, we can see that user experience is important as soon as you design, develop, or sell products or services. In the end, they will be purchased, used, and hopefully recommended by customers, so user experience is a fundamental component of that process. Considering user experience with regards to vehicles and the automotive sector is particularly interesting right now because we have reached a turning point. Indeed, several things are happening at once: The complexity of technology, functions and interaction possibilities with the vehicle is growing. Our vehicles can become connected with a myriad of things: our phones, other vehicles, our smart homes... and that results in seemingly endless interaction possibilities with the vehicle. For instance, we can check the vehicle status from our living room via Alexa, use our smartphone to remotely check the charging status of the car, use it as a digital key to open the VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 356 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-355 Generiert durch IP '34.222.142.22', am 04.11.2021, 00:21:31.

As a result, users are increasingly overwhelmed. At the same time, other consumer goods and services such as phones, banking/payment processes or online shopping are fundamentally changing and shaping customer expectations. They have taught us one essential thing: Betting on technology alone is not enough anymore; it does not provide a long-lasting advantage any longer. The experience with a product or a service has become a significant feature for differentiation. Last but not least, the forms of use for vehicles are getting more and more diverse. In the past, one would buy a car, own it for several years, sell it and buy the next one. Now you can buy a car, lease a car, rent a car, have a vehicle subscription or use car sharing. The users of these different cases also have different needs. Car-sharing users that only drive the vehicle for a couple of hours for instance don\u2019t have time to properly get to know the vehicle and all its functionalities. All that is something one must keep in mind when designing a vehicle or a particular feature. 2. Current market and the needs of users of electric and connected vehicles In 2020, the market for electric vehicles has exploded, reaching an all-time high of over 10 million vehicles worldwide. In comparison, the number of worldwide electric vehicles in 2014 was just under 850.000 [2]. We can see the same kind of trend for connected vehicles. In 2011, the global sales of cars with embedded telematics was of 1.3 million units. In 2019, it reached 28.5 million units [3]. And with customers getting more interested in these kinds of technologies and regulations pushing for these types of vehicles, we will be seeing more electric and connected vehicles in the future. As these trends have been and are catching on, I want to focus on one particular aspect, that, as I think, will be a decisive factor for the success of OEMs in the field. In the past years, fears have been voiced over the viability of electric vehicles, complaining about too small electrical ranges, an immature charging network or even an unappealing design of products. However, as time passes and technological, political, and infrastructural progress is being made, more and more people will want (or will have to) use electric and/or connected vehicles. And this VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 357 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-355 Generiert durch IP '34.222.142.22', am 04.11.2021, 00:21:31.

Fig. 1: Schematic of the law of diffusion, as defined by E. Rogers The dispersion of these innovations varies greatly on a worldwide scale, but several countries are already at a stage where significant diffusion will occur or is occurring [5]. We are thus witnessing the adoption of these technologies by the \u201cearly majority\u201d group. And contrary to the two early groups, the \u201cinnovators\u201d and the \u201cearly adopters\u201d, the \u201cearly majority\u201d has specific needs that must be addressed. Indeed, for this group, the sole prospect of trying out technology does not suffice. And they are much easily dissuaded or discouraged by hurdles and challenges. Things must be simple and clear. Technical difficulties and operational problems cannot be compensated by the thrill of trying out new technologies. Where \u201cinnovators\u201d and \u201cearly adopters\u201d are much more forgiving, the \u201cearly majority\u201d will be much more skeptical. If we apply this reasoning to electric and connected vehicles, we can deduce that it will get even more important to address fears such as sufficient electrical range and designing products and services that require little to no preliminary technological knowledge, that integrate themselves seamlessly in the customers\u2019 daily life. For electric vehicles this means for example, that planning a trip, even a long one, should be as easy and hassle free as with an internal combustion engine vehicle. For connected vehicle this could for instance mean, that the vehicle is compatible with smartphones and smarthome systems.

While achieving sufficient sampling of lipid dynamics remains a major challenge, a commonly used method to improve lipid sampling, e.g., in terms of specific interactions with membrane-associated proteins, is to randomize the initial arrangement of lipid constituents in multiple replicas of simulations, without changing the overall lipid composition of the membrane of interest. Here, we introduce a method that can rapidly generate multiple replicas of lipid bilayers with different spatial and conformational configurations for any given lipid composition. The underlying algorithm, which allows one to shuffle lipids at any desired level, relies on the application of an external potential, here referred to as the \"carving potential\", that removes clashes/entanglements before lipid positions are exchanged (shuffled), thereby minimizing the energy penalty due to abrupt lipid repositioning. The method is implemented as \"Membrane Mixer Plugin (MMP) 1.0\" in VMD, with a convenient graphical user interface that guides the user in setting various options and parameters. The plugin is fully automated and generates new membrane replicas more rapidly and conveniently than other analogous tools. The plugin and its capabilities introduced here can be extended to include additional features in future versions.", "year": 2022}

Numerical index of dynamic laser speckle (DLSI) was compared with motility assessment by light microscopy. Straws (n = 123) were thawed and evaluated as to velocity and cell motility. In assay one, each sample was lit by either kind of laser (red, n = 56; green, n = 20). In the second assay 46 samples were lit alternately by both laser sources. An index grouping velocity and motility was used to compare the evaluations. In a third assay a single sample was illuminated with both laser sources to assess the motility decreasing, and regression analysis of dynamic laser speckle index, velocity and motility index have been done. Correlations between dynamic laser speckle index, velocity and cell motility were r = 0.594; r = 0.734 and r = 0.665; r = 0.684 for samples illuminated by red and green laser, respectively. Correlation coefficients for red and green laser found between DLSI index and velocity (r = 0.801; r = 0.590), cell motility (r = 0.826; r = 0.613) and velocity and motility index (r = 0.840; r = 0.618), were significant (p < 0.01). No difference was observed between the laser sources that were sensitive in detecting semen activity, thus both of them can be used to generate the biospeckle phenomena and assess motility in the bull frozen semen. Introduction Semen analysis intends to determine the fertility potential of the ejaculate by conventional methods. Sperm motility is considered to be a good fertilization predictor, and high positive correlations were observed between spermatozoa motility and fertility in the human species [1], in the stallion [2], ovine [3] and cattle [4]. On the contrary, poor correlations were mentioned in some species [5]. In sperm motility analysis the semen kinetics evaluation by routine methods usually implies a subjective component [6,7] and an uncertainty degree [8]. Thus, methodology and the precision of the measurement are important to semen evaluation, as well as the choice of the right attribute, such as progressive motility [9]. In the last few years, the use of computer-assisted technologies improved the accuracy of semen analysis, however, these are high cost techniques and not suitable in many situations [10,11]. In addition, many studies observed positive and even high correlations between motility evaluation by conventional methods and computer-aided systems [12,13]. Many efforts have been done to increase the objectivity of the ancillary methodologies used to analyze semen samples [14,15]. Optical metrology is one such approach and was pioneering presented by Ross, et al. using laser illumination, the Doppler effect evaluation and correlation with semen motility [16]. The earliest works on spermatozoa (fish and rabbit sperm) showed that laser light scattering was strongly influenced by mobile cells, indicating its value as an assay of per cent motility [17]. First models (point scatterers) proposed by Harvey & Woolford assumed that spermatozoa behave as point particles moving with constant velocity [18]. However, these models proved to be inadequate, because sperm cells, particularly from rams and bulls, are large and far from being spherical in form. The interpretation of correlation Citation: Carvalho PHA, Rossi RODS, Lopes E, Santos APC, Sales JNS, et al. (2019) Bovine Frozen Semen Motility Analysis Using Two Different Laser Wavelengths. Adv Biochem Biotechnol 7: 1087. DOI: 10.29011/2574-7258.001087 2 Volume 7; Issue 02 Adv Biochem Biotehcnol, an open access journal ISSN: 2574-7258 functions on light scattered from bovine motile sperm requires a model which considers the size, shape, and unusual swimming trajectories of these cells. In addition, it was found that the spermatozoa exhibited a strong orientation effect, and the light scattered intensity was dominated by those cells swimming in a narrow angle which were almost perpendicular to the scattering vector. Further studies have pointed to the importance of immotile cells present in the ejaculate, interactions or collisions between motile and immotile cells, the distribution of spermatozoa within the scattering cell, spatial orientation effects and the shape of the bull spermatozoon in order to understand the spectrum or autocorrelation function of the scattered light by semen [19]. Other methodologies using the optical approach are the dynamic laser speckle or biospeckle laser techniques that was initially adapted in blood flow [20,21] and after applied to many phenomena related or not to a flow movement [22,23]. Previous report of our laboratory [24] showed the reliable use of the biospeckle laser as an approach to evaluate semen kinetic parameters. Nevertheless, different laser wavelengths can influence the activity of spermatozoa [25-27], compromising the DLSI outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biospeckle technique using two distinct wavelengths as a tool to measure the quality of bovine frozen semen samples under the view of motility parameters. Materials and Methods Semen Samples Semen of the bulls were diluted in citrate-yolk extender and frozen according to routine procedures. Briefly, ejaculates were diluted in yolk extender (lactose 7,4 nmol x L-1; eggyolk 20% v/v; added with 105 UI of penicillin K and 105 \u03bcg of diidroestreptomyicin), cooled at 5 \u00b0C for approximately 90 minutes, filled into 0.5 ml straws (IMV technologies, France) and after 4 hours at 5 \u00b0C for equilibration they were frozen. Samples were kept in liquid nitrogen (-196 \u00b0C) until the time of evaluation. Each sample was thawed in a water-bath at 37 \u00b0C, for 30 seconds, and then analyzed. The average sperm cell concentration used in all experiments was 10 million viable cells, and total concentration was 30 to 35 x 106 sperm cells per straw. Biospeckle Setup Experimental equipment consisted of low-power HeliumNeonium (He-Ne) and Solid State laser (power and wavelengths were 10 and 3 mW and 632 and 532 nm, respectively), a beam splitter, a mirror, a color digital Charge-Coupled Detector Device (CCD) and a computer with an image processor (Figure 1). A density filter was also used to ensure the same light intensity in the sample submitted to both laser sets in experiments II and III. The time history speckle patterns (512 images) were constructed using a CCD camera of 640x480 pixels. The speckle grains were always larger than the pixels; the backscattering configuration was the adopted to illuminate and to get the images in a frame rate of 0.08 seconds, which were processed forming the Time History Speckle Pattern of 512 x 512 pixels. That was the database adopted in the biospeckle image analysis and to obtain the Inertial Moment (IM), (numerical biospeckle index) based on a second order statistical result, with the use of an intensity dispersion matrix as a secondary image derived from the Time History Speckle Pattern (THSP), in accordance with Arizaga, et al. [28]. Figure 1: Equipment set-up. Experimental Design In experiment I, the straws (n=76) were thawed at 37 oC for 30 seconds and 10 \u03bcL were evaluated microscopically to measure sperm velocity (V) in a relative scale (1 slow to 5 fast movements) and Percent Sperm Cell Motility (PSCM) in slides with cover slips (15 x 15 mm), warmed in a hot platinum device [29]. In this study, 76 samples were illuminated by the red (n=56) and green (n=20) laser without a sequence, which means that specimens were lit by red laser and in other set of illuminations they were lit by the green one. Each sample was lit by either kind of laser (red and green), after a 30 seconds period of stabilization in the slide before biospeckle readings. The two laser sets in the visible range were analyzed by the biospeckle routine analysis. Inertial moment values were compared to routine semen evaluation using two evaluators, both trained in the same laboratory, who analyzed V and PSCM by light microscopy. In experiment II, 46 samples were illuminated by red and green lasers alternately, using the same set up and without moving the sample. Samples were submitted to the same period of stabilization described in the first experiment. The results Citation: Carvalho PHA, Rossi RODS, Lopes E, Santos APC, Sales JNS, et al. (2019) Bovine Frozen Semen Motility Analysis Using Two Different Laser Wavelengths. Adv Biochem Biotechnol 7: 1087.

Velocity and motility index was proposed as a form of direct comparison of a single measure evaluated by light microscopy and the IM generated by BSL. According to VMI, the same value, obtained in the same metrics, was given to V (measured in a 0 to 5 scale; folded by 20) and PSCM (measured in percentage; 0-100%) because up to this experiment the influence of each parameter in BSL analysis was unknown. This index was composed in accordance with the equation: VMI = 1\u20442 (20V + PSCM) (Eq. 1) In experiment III, one single sample was illuminated alternately, throughout time, with red and green laser in the same intensity, and the evaluations provided by IM and VMI were compared. Eight illuminations were performed at room temperature allowing two-minute intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 minutes after thawing). To each BSL results obtained, another light microscopy evaluation was done. The choice of light microscopy was due to the short time elapsed among the evaluations. Statistical Analysis In the first and second experiments, IM values for the combinations found among the classes of V and PSCM investigated with the two sources of laser (red and green) were evaluated by means of an exploratory analysis, involving the calculation of the mean and standard deviation. In the second experiment, the analyses included VMI data. In these experiments, three classes of PSCM (C", "year": 2019}

Therefore, treatment of articulation is clinically relevant in patients with dysarthria. In order to be effective and according to the principles of motor learning, articulation therapy needs to be intensive, well organized, with adequate feedback and requires frequent practice. Aims The aims of this pilot study are (1) to evaluate the feasibility of a virtual articulation therapy (VAT) to guide patients with dysarthria through a boost articulation therapy (BArT) program; (2) to evaluate the acoustic models\u2019 performance used for automatic phonological error detection; and (3) to validate the system by end\u2010users from their perspective. Methods & Procedures The VAT provides an extensive and well\u2010structured package of exercises with visual and auditory modelling and adequate feedback on the utterances. The tool incorporates automated methods to detect phonological errors, which are specifically designed to analyse Dutch speech production. A total of 14 subjects with dysarthria evaluated the acceptability, usability and user interaction with the VAT based on two completed therapy sessions using a self\u2010designed questionnaire. Outcomes & Results In general, participants were positive about the new computer\u2010based therapy approach. The algorithm performance for phonological error detection shows it to be accurate, which contributes to adequate feedback of utterance production. The results of the study indicate that the VAT has a user\u2010friendly interface that can be used independently by patients with dysarthria who have sufficient cognitive, linguistic, motoric and sensory skills to benefit from speech therapy. Recommendations were given by the end\u2010users to further optimize the program and to ensure user engagement. Conclusions & Implications The initial implementation of an automatic BArT shows it to be feasible and well accepted by end\u2010users. The tool is an appropriate solution to increase the frequency and intensity of articulation training that supports traditional methods. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Behavioural interventions to improve articulation in patients with dysarthria demand intensive treatments, repetitive practice and feedback. However, the current treatments are mainly limited in time to the interactive sessions in the presence of speech\u2013language pathology. Automatic systems addressing the needs of individuals with dysarthria are scarce. This study evaluates the feasibility of a VAT program and investigates its acceptability, usability and user interaction. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The computer\u2010based speech therapy approach developed and applied in this study intends to support intensive articulation training of patients with dysarthria. The virtual speech therapy offers the possibility of an individualized and customized therapy programme, with an extensive database of exercises, visual and auditory models of the target utterances, and providing adequate feedback based on automatic acoustic analysis of speech. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The automatic BArT overcomes the limitation in time of face\u2010to\u2010face traditional speech therapy. It offers patients the opportunity to have access to speech therapy more intensively and frequently in their home environment.", "year": 2021}

We focus on Emergency Department (ED) patients, who currently lack a sense of predictability about their medical journey, which increases the occurrences of frustration and aggression. ED patients need a better understanding about their ED procedures. We suggest and describe a system for providing real-time information to ED patients regarding the procedures in their ED medical journey.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The purpose of this study was to develop a system that provides patients with dynamically updated information about the specific procedures and expected wait times their personal ED journey comprises, and to report initial evaluations of this system.\n \n \n METHODS\n To develop the system myED, we extracted information from hospital databases and translated it using process mining and user interface (UI) design into a language that is accessible and comprehensible to patients. We evaluate the system using a mixed-methods approach, combining observations, interviews and online records.\n \n \n RESULTS\n Interviews with patients, escorts and Health Care Providers (HCPs) confirm patients\u2019 need for information about their personal ED journey. Our iterative work with ED patients, HCPs, and a multidisciplinary team of developers enabled provision of such information in a secure, effective and user-friendly way.\nIn the third month after deployment, 492 of 1,614 patients (30.48%), used myED.

These technologies, in general, and websites, in particular, provide an organisation with the opportunity to tap into global markets, reach a larger audience, communicate with its stakeholders, as well as improve the operational efficiency and image of the organisation (Ganiyu et al., 2017; Mentes & Turan, 2012). As such, websites are an essential tool for surviving in both the highly competitive local and global markets (Mentes & Turan, 2012). Approximately two billion websites are available on the Internet and more are developed on a daily basis, which demonstrates that more organisations, including universities, recognise the importance of having a well-developed website (InternetLiveStats, 2018). For universities, websites serve as a valuable communication tool (Bairamzadeh & Bolhari, 2010) and are considered the source most used to access university-related content (Buang et al., 2016). Therefore, universities are increasingly dependent on their websites to function as an information provider (ElHalees & Abu-Zaid, 2017). Not only are websites increasing in numbers on a daily basis, but the numbers of internet users and the time they spend on the Internet are also increasing. In January 2018, more than half of the world\u2019s population of close to 7.6 billion were active users of the internet. This is seven percent more compared to Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 4 July 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 159 January 2017. In South Africa, there were 30.81 million internet users in January 2018, which are 54 percent of South Africa\u2019s total population and an increase of seven percent from 2017. This number is expected to increase during 2018. Currently, these users spend an average of approximately eight and a half hours on the internet per day (McDonald, 2018). Of these internet users, a staggering 65.77 percent are represented by the Generation Y cohort (MyBroadband, 2018). The Generation Y cohort, also known as the millennials or the internet generation (Severt, Fjelstul & Breiter, 2013), includes those individuals born between 1986 and 2005 (Markert, 2004). Individuals of this cohort are characterised as being independent, self-reliant, confident, and well educated (Broadbridge, Maxwell & Ogden, 2007). Compared to previous generations, Generation Y is the first generation with access to several multimedia platforms, mobile phones, convergent technologies and the internet (Schlitzkus, Schenarts & Schenarts, 2010), rendering them the most technologically astute generation to date. As part of their daily lives, Generation Y enjoys browsing the internet (Bilgihan, 2016) and playing on social networking sites (Severt et al., 2013). This digitally connected generation frequently uses the internet to find information that could assist with their decision-making (Valentine & Powers, 2013). From a marketing perspective, literature suggests that Generation Y customers are sceptical of the media and of online content that feels generic or like a sales pitch (Ali, 2015; Bubser, 2016). As such, traditional online marketing has proven to be less effective (Colucci & Cho, 2014). St Louis (2017) agrees and states that Generation Y customers\u2019 dismissive attitude towards traditional online marketing efforts could be due to the lack of trust in an organisation. Trust within an online context plays an important role. This is because the customer has no direct control over the actions of the product or service provider (Muda, Mohd & Hassan, 2016). In addition, the internet increases organisations\u2019 interpersonal distance from their customers, which may also create trust issues (Benamati & Serva, 2007). Therefore, it comes as no surprise that one of the main reasons why customers avoid engaging in online undertakings is due to the lack of trust (Muda et al., 2016). For any website to be considered successful, it is important that users perceive it as trustworthy (Bilgihan, 2016). Trust refers to an individual\u2019s confidence in another entity\u2019s conduct when the individual is in a vulnerable position or has no control over the other entity (Hosmer, 1995; Lewicki, Mcallister & Bies, 1998). Trust is also defined as an individual\u2019s psychological expectations that a trusted party will not behave opportunistically (Kim, Shin & Lee, 2009). A number of studies related to the quality of a website within specific contexts, namely online auctions (Gregg & Walczak, 2010), online hotel bookings (Lien, Wen, Huang & Wu, 2015) and consumer-generated media (Filieri, Alguezaui & McLeay, 2015) found that website quality has a significant positive influence on trust in these websites. Various other online studies (Hsiao, Lin, Wang, Lu & Yu, 2010; Kim, Xu & Koh 2004; Zhou & Zhang, 2009) also validate the relationship between website quality and trust in the website. These findings suggest that high website quality is associated with greater trust in a website, which, in turn, is likely to translate into customers perceiving the product and service provider as competent, honest and benevolent (Liang & Chen, 2009). In terms of university websites, two particularly important aspects contribute to the overall quality of the website and subsequently foster greater trust, namely the system and information quality of the website. Considering the growing number of Generation Y students enrolled at South African higher education institutions (HEIs), and university websites primarily being the first point of reference in sourcing and evaluating information about the university and the courses offered, as well as Generation Y students\u2019 scepticism about marketing tactics and their low trust propensity, it is imperative to understand the factors that influence this generation\u2019s trust in university websites. As such, the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of perceived system and information quality on Generation Y students\u2019 trust in university websites within the South African context. Literature review System quality Perceived system quality is defined as customers\u2019 opinions of a website\u2019s performance in terms of information delivery and retrieval (Yang, Cai, Zhou & Zhou, 2005). System quality refers to the consistency of a website\u2019s interface and ease of navigation. Difficult website navigation is one of the main barriers of many online undertakings. A well-designed website that is easy to navigate will enhance Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 4 July 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 160 customer experience and satisfaction and will ultimately lead to trust in and the success of the website (Kuan, Bock & Vathanophas, 2008). As such, customers assess the system-based qualities of a website to determine whether the product or service provider is trustworthy (Kim et al., 2004). A website with adequate system quality and technicalities will enhance the convenience to users and increase customers\u2019 confidence and trust in the organisation (Liang & Chen, 2009). It is therefore recommended that organisations invest considerable time and effort in designing a website that contains effective link structures and interfaces, ultimately making the website user-friendly and trustworthy (Kuan et al., 2008). Other factors that contribute to the system quality of a website include the security of the website (Ahn, Ryu & Han, 2007) as well as several appearance factors, namely the lay-out of the website, text fonts, colours and the graphics-text balance (Aladwani & Palviab, 2002). As such, system quality is observable in a website\u2019s overall performance (Lin, 2007). These contributing factors hold especially true for Generation Y customers and students, as they grew up with technology and expect a website to have certain aesthetics and functionality (Djamasbi, Siegel & Tullis, 2010).

Information Sciences, 306, 34-52. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2015.01.034 Abstract. Because effective influencers in an online social network (OSN) can significantly affect consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions via trust among users in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) marketing, identifying these influencers with respect to user trust relationships has become increasingly important. However, many existing studies overlook the domain attribute of trust and the time-varying nature of social networks and only analyze a static snapshot of a user trust network (UTN).

To address these issues and investigate this topic in the ecommerce context, this study proposes a research framework that takes into FACTORS INFLUENCING CONSUMER TRUST IN ONLINE STORES 12 account the dimensions of trust, domain, and time. A time-varying hypergraph is developed to model the OSN using the time-varying features of multi-type relationships, and an algorithm is developed to extract a domain-aware UTN based on the time-varying hypergraph and user trust relationships. Reinforced by the dimensions of trust, domain, and time, a novel product review domain-aware (PRDA) approach is conceived that identifies effective influencers and categorizes them into three types, i.e., emerging influencers, holding influencers, and vanishing influencers, based on their popularity status across the life cycle. The experimental results from the E-pinions dataset show that the PRDA approach outperforms both the social network-based influence-evaluating approach and the \u2018\u2018popular author\u2019\u2019 approach. Summary. This quantitative, empirical research study examines best practices for online retailers who seek to build consumer trust through the use of social network resources and online word-of-mouth marketing. The authors assert that effective use of social media can help online retailers reach more customers and also increase their response rate by building online trust. They seek to identify effective influencers among online social networks and onsite consumer reviews. By identifying these effective influencers, online retailers can save costs by focusing their marketing efforts on the potential customers with the highest likelihood of influencing others.

English is a communication tool. In order to achieve this goal, college English has been reformed, aiming to expand students' vocabulary and improve students' listening and speaking ability. To keep up with English teaching reform, teachers should update their teaching methods. At present, many colleges and universities have begun to use corpus in English teaching. This paper mainly introduces the corpus and its creation, expounds the advantages of combining corpus and English teaching, and analyzes the practical application of corpus in college English teaching, hoping to have some reference significance for college English teaching. Following the corresponding linguistic principles, successively occurring segments of speech or language use texts are collected, and the electronic library that is subsequently constructed is called a corpus. Nowadays, it has entered the information age. The corpus will be combined with computer technology in the process of establishment. This makes the corpus more accurate retrieval, real corpus and larger capacity. It is precisely because the corpus has many advantages, so the current college English the corpus has been widely used in language education, and the corpus has begun to play an increasingly important role as a language-assisted teaching tool. I. Overview of the Corpus and the Way to Create English Corpus in Colleges and Universities (1) Overview of the Corpus The corpus belongs to a large-scale electronic library. The linguistic phenomenon can be reflected by the corpus, because the written or spoken English that users often use in daily life can be collected into the corpus, the fictional discourses that are randomly fabricated by the individual, or randomly from the book. Excerpts such as illustrations cannot be used as corpus materials or linguistic information [1]. The corpus knowledge stored in the computer is called corpus linguistics. Language teaching and research is deeply influenced by corpus linguistics. The application of corpus in college English teaching can provide real texts for teachers' classroom teaching and enrich students' vocabulary. Therefore, many college English teachers prefer to use the corpus as a language-assisted teaching tool in classroom activities. (2) Creation of English Corpus in Colleges and Universities First, ensure the rationality of the selected language material. The value of the corpus established in college English teaching depends on the language material chosen. At present, most of the corpora in college English teaching originate from college English textbooks. In order to improve the use of corpus, college English textbooks with higher recognition and wider application range should be selected when choosing college English corpus materials [2]. Second, create a college English corpus in two steps. In the first step, in order for the search software to process the scanned files, the materials scanned in the college English textbooks need to be converted into plain text files. In the second step, in order to make the search results clearly presented on the search software interface, the segmentation, branch, and clause processing of the pure corpus should follow the corresponding labeling rules or typesetting. 2019 9th International Conference on Social Science and Education Research (SSER 2019) Copyright \u00a9 (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/sser.2019.311 1541 II.The Advantages of Using Corpus in College English Teaching (1) Advantage 1: Openness and Autonomy The use of corpus in college English teaching will make teachers' teaching and students' learning have the advantages of openness and autonomy, and change the traditional learning style of students. Students can take the initiative to use the corpus to conduct multiple retrieval studies. Students and teachers use corpus to motivate them to solve problems with corpus [3]. Because the classroom teaching time and the teacher's knowledge reserve are limited, the teacher can not teach all the language rules to the students. Students can use the corpus to discover these language rules and help students solve some practical problems. Therefore, the use of corpus in college English teaching can expand the breadth and depth of students' knowledge, update the teaching philosophy of teachers, and thus improve the effectiveness of college English teaching. (2) Advantage 2: Authenticity The corpus applied in college English teaching can reflect the true and objective language application rules, because its corpus is derived from the language with strong timeliness and high authenticity [4]. In addition, the corpus is generally explored by a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The corpus retrieval results are authentic and objective, because different types of retrieval software can check, check and compare corpus corpus multiple times. III.The Practical Application of Corpus in College English Teaching (1) Improve Students' Learning Autonomy At present, all subject teaching emphasizes the prominent position of students, and the \u201cinstilled\u201d teaching mode has been negated by all teaching staff. Therefore, if teachers want to achieve the all-round development of students, they need to completely change this \"cramming\" teaching mode. Students should start their own teaching activities so that students can actively participate in teaching activities to achieve life and teachers. Good interaction between. College English teachers use corpus in classroom teaching to improve student initiative. For example, the teacher can set the corresponding questions, let the students search in the corpus according to the questions, and then summarize the search results. The students can also discuss the search results. The corpus allows the students to have the opportunity to participate in the classroom activities and train the students. The logical thinking has a positive effect on the students' independent learning ability [5]. (2) Guiding Students to Fully Understand the Meaning of Vocabulary In the traditional classroom, college English teachers generally explain the meaning of vocabulary according to the textbooks. In order to let students understand the vocabulary usage, teachers will give examples. However, there are not many examples. Students can only remember the words spoken by teachers through rote memorization. And sometimes students' understanding of vocabulary is not in place, so students can't be proficient in using vocabulary. But using a corpus can change this situation. Students can use the corpus to search and get a lot of vocabulary related examples, and these examples are the same as everyday language habits. These vivid examples and real context can help students understand more thoroughly. The meaning of vocabulary, understanding and then remembering can achieve twice the result with half the effort. (3) Increasing the Interest of College English Classes In the traditional classroom activities, college English teachers pay more attention to the textbook itself, and they will carry out their own teaching activities according to the textbooks. However, because the content of the textbook itself is limited, the teaching activities are not vivid enough and are not attractive enough for students [6] ]. Currently, the use of corpora in college English teaching can increase the fun of classroom activities. Because the corpus itself has a certain relevance to the textbook, it is more widely used than the textbook. The teacher can select the article corresponding to the textbook from the corpus as the lecture content, because the content in", "year": 2019}

Each topic has been popular in JME, and each of these articles builds on a sizeable and established literature. As such, this issue offers an update in four important areas. We launch this issue with Neu\u2019s study on how students select team members, and then we move to Chen, Benedictus, Kim, and Shih\u2019s article on design thinking and facilitating student creativity. Ackerman and Chung offer insights into yet another and underresearched bias in student evaluations of teaching. Lee, Heinze, Donoho, Fournier, Jalal, and Cohen present the results of a multinational study of student perceptions of sales ethics. Neu extends some interesting and provocative findings from two of his earlier qualitative studies published in JME (2012, 2015). In the first of two quantitative studies in the current article, Neu shows that most students do indeed form social networks as they progress through a program, and these networks guide their choices of teammates on group projects. In this study, trust emerges as an important characteristic of preferred team members. In his second study, Neu more clearly validates findings from his earlier qualitative work. In the absence of other information, students use social cues, in particular the style of dress, to evaluate the trustworthiness and trust of potential teammates. I found these results, while not particularly surprising, to be concerning. As we strive for greater inclusiveness in higher education, a common practice of allowing students to select their own groups may systematically put some students at an educational disadvantage, particularly students who may not conform to the majority\u2019s stereotype of a trustworthy individual. The issues of helping students develop their peer networks and facilitating inclusiveness in student teams are important areas for future research. In this issue\u2019s second article, Chen, Benedictus, Kim, and Shih demonstrate two different approaches to design thinking. Both approaches should be beneficial to students as marketing managers, but the differences between the two approaches can provide students with a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in different approaches to design. In the user-centered design (UCD) approach, marketers focus on how design meets consumer needs; in the design-driven innovation (DDI) approach, marketers focus on radical product aesthetics. The authors explain in detail how each approach can be taught. They demonstrate that the UCD approach can yield designs perceived to be more useful, while the DDI approach can yield designs that are higher in perceived originality. The authors also demonstrate how the effectiveness of either approach may depend on whether the consumer experience is more utilitarian or more hedonic. Thus, the approaches themselves should be helpful to students, and the insights into possible tradeoffs between functionality and novelty, and the importance of context, can provide students with a deeper insight into the design process itself. As student evaluations of teaching (SET) are a prominent element in most merit reviews and promotion decisions for marketing faculty, education researchers have explored a number of possible biases in SET. Ackerman and Chung examine social modeling, which is an understudied bias in SET. This bias exists with online faculty evaluations (e.g., RateMyProfessors.com) when students see ratings of the teacher of interest before they provide their own ratings. Ackerman and Chung present evidence that prior ratings may indeed bias subsequent student ratings in much the same way that poll results can influence voter sentiments through the bandwagon effect. Thus, a few positive RateMyProfessors evaluations of a teacher can lead to higher ratings in the future, while a few bad ratings can lead to lower ratings. Students and faculty who use RateMyProfessors scores to evaluate faculty should take this bias into account. This social modeling effect may explain in part the modest correlation between university-run SET and RateMyProfessors. In recent years, higher education has experienced an explosive growth in the number of sales centers on campuses, and JME has published articles on sales education with increasing frequency. One of the primary challenges in sales education is that many students have negative associations with sales careers, and they may reject what might otherwise be a quite satisfying career.

To surmount this challenge, the plan suggests crafting an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) solution tailored for home decor. This AR-based application aims to empower users by enabling them to virtually position, manipulate, and engage with home decor products within their domiciles, thereby offering an immersive and realistic shopping experience. Emphasizing convenience, precision, and user-friendliness, the proposed platform seeks to bridge the divide between the convenience of online shopping and the tangible experience of physically arranging decor items. Leveraging ARCore for Augmented Reality implementation and API2Cart for seamless shopping integration, the approach promises a seamless amalgamation of high-fidelity 3D models, lifelike rendering, and an intuitive interface. The project's methodology advocates for a phased development strategy, with each iteration geared towards achieving specific objectives. Ultimately, the goal is to furnish users with a dynamic and responsive environment where they can effortlessly manipulate and interact with placed furniture, facilitating well-informed decision-making. This innovative fusion of AR and mobile technology holds the potential to redefine the furniture industry, ushering in a more interactive and customer-centric shopping experience.

Herniter presented the High School Autonomous Vehicle Competition (HSAVC), which introduces autonomous driving to high school students. The competition promotes STEM education by challenging participants to use MATLAB to create a vision-based track detection algorithm and Simulink to build a motor controller model. Following the COVID-19 global pandemic, many in-person STEM competitions were canceled, including HSAVC. The goal of the Autonomous Driving Simulation Platform is to replicate the physical conditions of HSAVC using simulation to allow students to continue the activity virtually. Using MATLAB, the Simulation Platform creates a real-time virtual environment for students to test their HSAVC track detection algorithms and motor controller models. The Simulation Platform consists of two MATLAB apps: a Track Generator and a Driving Simulator. The Track Generator application can create fixed tracks based on user inputs or randomized tracks based on user-defined lengths. The Track Generator utilizes a growth and mutation algorithm to create a track with three distinct track sections: straight, left curve, and right curve. The Track Generator\u2019s randomized track replicates the HSAVC\u2019s physical track, and the Driving Simulator replicates the HSAVC\u2019s 1:18 scale autonomous vehicle equipped with a linescan camera, two drive motors, and a servo motor with a vehicle model and a camera model. The Track Generator and Driving Simulator have been successfully designed and implemented with MATLAB App Designer. Users can create a track and test their algorithms and models through an intuitive interface, making it an effective tool for STEM education in any classroom. The Autonomous Driving Simulation Platform holds potential as a solution to continue the HSAVC during the pandemic and can increase student engagement in the HSAVC from high schools around the world like Amazon Web Services DeepRacer. Another benefit of the Simulation Platform is convenient and controlled virtual algorithm testing, which allows for repetitive experimentation to be simulated without risk of damaged materials. The simulation platform has broad potential as an educational tool, such as complementing high school robotics curriculums to teach motor control algorithms and training reinforced learning racing models. The successful virtual adaptation of HSAVC demonstrates how simulation can provide many educational benefits when borrowing the framework of STEM competition.", "year": 2021}

We introduce Creepy Tracker, an open-source toolkit to ease prototyping with multiple commodity depth cameras. It automatically selects the best sensor to follow each person, handling occlusions and maximizing interaction space, while providing full-body tracking in scalable and extensible manners. It also keeps position and orientation of stationary interactive surfaces while offering continuously updated point-cloud user representations combining both depth and color data. Our performance evaluation shows that, although slightly less precise than marker-based optical systems, Creepy Tracker provides reliable multi-joint tracking without any wearable markers or special devices.

Our action research project approach accomplished two different goals: (1) to inculcate design thinking in pupils, and (2) to sensitize children on bullying victimization. Our approach uses a range of participatory design methods to distil design ideas from children and to support their design thinking aiming to boost children\u2019s creative confidence and develop social and emotional skills. Key findings from our project are: (1) children made valuable design contributions including realistic bullying scenarios, language content, user interface design, storyline progression, character profiles, coping strategies etc., and (2) participatory design and design thinking stimulated ethical reasoning, reflection and empathy in children on bullying victimization. Our approach is unique in the current design thinking landscape, because it moves from designing \u201cthing\u201d (object) to designing \u201cthink\u201d (bullying sensitization). Future research should focus on highlighting ways how participatory design and design thinking enrich and complement each other. The significance of our paper stems from the simple standpoint that those participating in a design should gain from participating in the design process. Takeaways for practitioners are: (1) building relationships with stakeholders, especially children, (2) empathy and user research techniques, (2) translating field data into usable insights, (3) idea-generation and rapid concept development, (4) product co-prototyping, (5) user engagement and co-creation, (6) multiple perspectives on effective communication.", "year": 2019}

However, compliance with therapy can be a problem that undermines the prospective advantages of telerehabilitation technologies. Lack of motivation has been identified as a major factor that hampers compliance. Exploring various motivational interventions, the integration of citizen science activities in robotics-based rehabilitation has been shown to increase patients\u2019 motivation to engage in otherwise tedious exercises by tapping into a vast array of intrinsic motivational drivers. Patient engagement can be further enhanced by the incorporation of social interactions. Objective Herein, we explored the possibility of bolstering engagement in physical therapy by leveraging cooperation among users in an environmental citizen science project. Specifically, we studied how the integration of cooperation into citizen science influences user engagement, enjoyment, and motor performance. Furthermore, we investigated how the degree of interdependence among users, such that is imposed through independent or joint termination (JT), affects participation in citizen science-based telerehabilitation. Methods We developed a Web-based citizen science platform in which users work in pairs to classify images collected by an aquatic robot in a polluted water canal. The classification was carried out by labeling objects that appear in the images and trashing irrelevant labels. The system was interfaced by a haptic device for fine motor rehabilitation. We recruited 120 healthy volunteers to operate the platform. Of these volunteers, 98 were cooperating in pairs, with 1 user tagging images and the other trashing labels. The other 22 volunteers performed both tasks alone. To vary the degree of interdependence within cooperation, we implemented independent and JTs. Results We found that users\u2019 engagement and motor performance are modulated by their assigned task and the degree of interdependence. Motor performance increased when users were subjected to independent termination (P=.02), yet enjoyment decreased when users were subjected to JT (P=.005). A significant interaction between the type of termination and the task was found to influence productivity (P<.001) as well as mean speed, peak speed, and path length of the controller (P=.01, P=.006, and P<.001, respectively). Conclusions Depending on the type of termination, cooperation was not always positively associated with engagement, enjoyment, and motor performance. Therefore, enhancing user engagement, satisfaction, and motor performance through cooperative citizen science tasks relies on both the degree of interdependence among users and the perceived nature of the task. Cooperative citizen science may enhance motivation in robotics-based telerehabilitation, if designed attentively.", "year": 2019}

Over time, interfaces are becoming more complex due to the increased functionality of these devices. For example, the most common type of phone is called a \u201csmart phone\u201d and is an indispensable instrument for many people. It combines numerous features and therefore fulfills many needs of the owner for personal and business purposes. It is not only the efficient use of a product that leads to a buying decision, even more diverse phenomena are influencing our behavior when it comes to purchasing. One of the most complex and dynamic factors within the human-machine interaction is the user experience (Roto et al., 2011). Due to the differing views of the user experience within the areas of product development (marketing, design e.g.) and user research (cognitive and business psychology e.g.), multiple theories and models have been derived to explain the nature of this specific experience (i. a. Th\u00fcring & Mahlke, 2007; Karapanos, Zimmerman, Forlizzi & Martens, 2009; ISO 9241-210, 2010). The conceptual model ContinUE (Continuous User Experience) by Pohlmeyer (2011) describes different phases and their user experience: the anticipated experience (pre-use phase), the real experience (use phase), the reflective experience (post-use phase), the retrospective experience (past-use phase), and the prospective experience (re-use phase) anticipated with a similar product/system. All of these phases are subject to different influencing factors that can lead to shortand/or long-term effects and change the user\u2019s (future) behaviour. How mere-exposure can influence these phases and therefore the long-term user experience is subject of the present research. Results show that a mere-exposure effect for the evaluation of instrumental and non-instrumental product qualities leads to a specific user experience. But the mere-exposure effect is influenced by multiple factors e.g. kinds of stimuli, ways of stimuli presentation and dimensions of evaluation (liking e.g.). Additionally, the occurrence of the hedonic halo-effect, known from early use phases, could be observed again within the past-use phase. In conclusion, this study supports and highlights the definition of user experience as a complex and dynamic phenomenon within the human-machine interaction.", "year": 2016}

The analysis of the development of scientific opinion regarding the transformation of approaches to the digitalization of enterprise activity management processes was carried out. It was determined that digitalization should be understood as the transformation of existing analog (electronic) products, processes and business models of the organization, which is based on the effective using of digital technologies. The consequences of the growth of global competition in the global market are presented and, as a result, changes in the activities of modern enterprises under the influence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, namely: business models, collaboration, user interfaces, value chains, and even the traditional pyramid of automation, which is currently undergoing major changes. It has been established that the set of management methods varies depending on the type and directions of the enterprise. Accordingly, digitalization methods are determined in accordance with the standard structure of the enterprise, namely: management, middle management, logistics, production and marketing. The advantages and disadvantages of each group of methods and instruments are analyzed. In particular, it has been determined that the most relevant method for management is the deployment of the company's database and servers in a cloud database, which will allow the company to digitize all structural divisions without possible loss of any critical data. It was established that the digitization of methods and tools of the middle level of management will make it possible to minimize costs, increase the level of profitability, and optimize the production cycle. It was determined that logistics departments at any enterprise are the driving force of every production, which is why the implementation of digitalization methods is currently relevant and has undeniable advantages for all participants in the logistics chain. The production link at the enterprise is its basis and the reason for which the enterprise was created, namely the production of the product. Despite on the disadvantages common to all innovations due to significant costs for the priority implementation of the specified methods - their effect will create prerequisites for the sustainable development of the enterprise in the future, increasing in economy, rhythm of production and increasing in the volume of the produced products. It has been established that the modern methods of digitalization of work in marketing departments of modern enterprises make it possible to create effective mechanisms for studying user needs, optimize sales of the company's product, automate the data bank on product sales and increase understanding the product by the users. The place of Ukraine in the IMD World Digital Competitiveness Ranking during 2017-2022 was determined, as part of the analysis, it was established that during 2019-2021, the position of Ukraine significantly is strengthened from 60th place to 54th (among 64 countries in the overall rating), which indicates the presence of positive changes in the direction of digital changes in the country. The key problems which were done a negative impact on the process of digitalization of the management of activities of domestic enterprises and, as a result, reduce their competitiveness in the conditions of the digital economy, have been identified. It was established that despite on the existing problems, modern enterprises are actively implementing modern digitalization methods and tools in order to increase the efficiency of their work and strengthen their market positions.", "year": 2023}

While there are various forms of crowdsourcing, such as open innovation, civic engagement and crowdfunding in this work we specifically focus on microtasking. Microtasking is a branch of crowdsourcing, where a work is presented as a set of identical microtasks, each requiring contributors only several minutes to complete usually in exchange for a reward of less than 1 USD. Labeling images, transcribing documents, analyzing sentiments of short sentences and cleaning datasets are popular examples of work which could be solved as microtasks. Available up to date microtask crowdsourcing platforms, such as CrowdFlower and Amazon Mechanical Turk, allow thousands of microtasks to be solved in parallel by hundreds of contributors available online. To tackle the problem of quality in microtask crowdsourcing, it is necessary to study different quality attributes, to investigate what causes low quality of results and slow task execution in microtask crowdsourcing, to identify effective methods to both assess and assure that these quality attributes are of high level. We conducted the most extensive literature review analysis of quality attributes, assessment and assurance techniques ever done in the area of microtasking and crowdsourcing in general.

Because of its sociotechnical rather than purely engineered nature, not only is the Web changing society but also we shape the way the technology evolves. The whole process is inherently co-constituted and as such its evolution is unlike any other system. In order to understand how the Web might evolve in the future - for good or bad - we need to study how it has evolved since its inception and the associated emergent behaviours. We call this new research discipline Web Science [1,2], and it is important for all our futures that we urgently address its major research challenges. We are fast becoming part of a world of digital inter-connectivity, where devices such as smartphones, watches, fitness trackers, and household goods are part of a growing network, capable of sharing data and information. Increasingly, the Web has become the ubiquitous interface to access this network of devices. From sensors, to mobile applications, to fitness devices, these devices are transmitting their data to - often - centralised pools of data, which then become available via Web services. The sheer scale of this data leads to a rich set of high-volume, real-time streams of human activity, which are often is made publicly consumable (potentially at a cost) via some API. For academia, the combination of these sources are providing social scientists and digital ethnographers a far richer understanding of society, and how we as individuals operate. These streams represent a global network of human and machine communication, interaction, and transaction, and with the right analytical methods, may contain valuable research and commercial insights. In domains such as health and fitness for example, the aggregation of data from mobile devices is supporting the transition towards the quantified-self, and offers rich insight into the health and well-being of individuals, with the potential of diagnosing or decreasing disease. Why the need for Web Observatories? Studying the Web provides us with critical insights about how we as individuals and society operate in the digital world. The actions, communications, interactions, and transactions produced by humans and machines has the potential to offer rich insight into our world, allowing us to better understand how we operate at a micro and macro scale. However, there are a number of barriers that prevent researchers from making the most of those data resources. Herein lies a challenge, and a great opportunity. We are now in a position where the technologies used within the big data processing pipeline are maturing, as are the methods we use to analyse data to provide valuable insights. Yet, overshadowing these benefits are issues of data access, control, and ownership. Whilst the data being produced continue to grow, their availability beyond the walled-gardens of the data holder - whether commercial or institutional - reduce the full potential of analysis envisaged in the big data era. (a) Datasets are distributed across different domains (b) Metadata about those datasets are not available or are in different vocabularies/formats, (c) Searching or for or inside datasets is not possible, (d) Applying analytics on one or more datasets requires copying them into a central location, (e) Datasets are often provided in the context of specific disciplines lacking the metadata and enrichment that could make them available in other disciplines, (f) The nature of some of the datasets often requires access control in the interest of privacy. (g) There is a need for engines that lower the barrier of engagement with analytics for individuals, organisations and interdisciplinary research communities by supporting the easy application of analytics across datasets without requiring them to be copied into a central location, (h) There is a need for services enabling the publication and sharing of analytical tools within and across interdisciplinary communities. Addressing the challenges described above, we have introduced the Web Observatory [3], a globally distributed infrastructure that enables users to share data with each other, whilst retaining control over who can view, access, query, and download their data. At its core, a Web Observatory comprises of a list of architectural principles that describe a scalable solution to enable controlled access to heterogeneous forms of historical and real-time data, visualisations, and analytics. In order to handle these new forms of big, and small data, significant effort has gone into developing technologies capable of storing, querying, and analysing high-volume datasets - or streams - in a timely fashion, returning useful insights of social activity and behaviour. A Global Network of Web Observatories The Web Observatory (WO) project, developed under the auspices of the Web Science Trust, aims to develop the standards and services that will interlink a number of existing or emergent Web Observatories to enable the sharing, discoverability and use of public or private datasets and analytics across Web Observatories, on a large, distributed scale (http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/big.2014.0035). It involves the publication or sharing of both datasets and analytic or visualisation tools (http://webscience.org/web-observatory/). At the same time, it involves the development of appropriate standards to enable the discovery, use, combination and persistence of those resources; effort in the direction of standards is already underway in the W3C Web Observatory community group (http://www.w3.org/community/webobservatory/). International research collaboration is one of the primary goals of creating a network of Web Observatories. There has already been significant effort in creating a number of Web Observatory nodes globally [4,5] In this paper will describe an instance of the Web Observatory, the Southampton Web Observatory (SUWO) and how it is being applied both at Southampton and at other institutions in areas such as integrated health management in particular in support of an aging population We believe that the true potential of the Web Observatory vision will be realised when the different observatories become part of a global network of Wide Web of Observatories, allowing cross-observatory querying and analysis. Only through working through a set of initial application areas, we will show the immediate value that the Web Observatory platform will provide, from the sharing of datasets and resources, to improving international collaboration and research opportunities as a result of the raised awareness of institutional resources.

We found that building on known image schemas improved response time on look\u2010up tasks, while contextual detail predicted increases in persistence and the number of inferences drawn from the data. Schema\u2010congruency combined with contextual detail produced the highest gains in comprehension. These findings provide concrete mechanisms by which designers presenting large data sets through metaphorical interfaces may improve their effectiveness and appeal with users.", "year": 2017}

Analytics applications are primarily based on Network Programming techniques, Data Structure Design and Implementation, Database Management Systems, Human Factors and Interfaces, Web Development Frameworks, Data and Information Visualization and Data Mining. Social Media with their broad content and their Application Programming Interfaces, as well as mobile devices which enhance the experience by extending the geographical boundaries of their accessibility. This research aims at analyzing the status quo, studying and proposing advances of Web Analytics applications and providing a software prototype, including innovative Analytics techniques. Problems and arising issues are pointed out, and appropriate solutions and techniques are presented, that provide software specifications and implementations of systems that offer full insight to the way web and E-Commerce applications operate, as well as to the mode they are visited and used by customers and the public using the Internet. Metrics concerning performance and customer habits and visitor behavior are examined and various algorithms and environments that have been developed to provide them are described. Hardware and Software innovations resulting to a perpetual evolution of platforms and foundations used to develop and operate Web Applications are taken into consideration. How the evolution of platforms is dealt with, is an interesting topic that has been analyzed here as well. This perpetual evolution triggers the development of appropriate techniques to accommodate and support adaptive measurement technologies and Analytics applications. Several solutions that have been implemented are presented in this work. Big Data techniques, that allow horizontal scaling of the volume of data the application can support, as well as enrichment of the variety of data sources provide a more accurate, higher velocity, saving time and give a more exact picture of the operation and finally remote accessibility to the e-commerce application. In addition to data collected internally by the web server, running the web application and enriched by Big Data techniques, data sources such as various Social Media Applications are also used to enhance the information collection ever further. Social Media offer large possibilities of combining personal information from external sources and allow the analyzer to complete the insight. There are various forms of Analytics applications and add-ons. In general Analytics applications can be viewed as compound systems or often as mash-up applications that operate as web-based applications, desktop applications or even both. The work-flow consists of four general groups of functionalities that can be conceptually viewed and implemented in a variety of ways: \u2022Data Collection \u2022Data Preparation & Storage \u2022Computational and Mining \u2022Result Presentation and Data Visualization The data collection procedure traditionally is based on extracting data from various sources and log files that are being generated by the web server, hosting the web application. Additional sources are used in parallel that enhance the information and provide a more consistent and global view of the users\u2019 profile. The collected data need preparation before storage. This preparation involves locating the data sources, cleaning up redundant and unnecessary data, separating data fields, grouping and indexing. Storage takes place mainly in relational database systems, to provide flexible support for complicated queries, data correlations and searches at a later phase. Computational algorithms, data mining techniques and applications form the kernel-layer of the Analyzer. They generate metrics based on the collected data sets and enhance the existing data sets by importing additional information from external sources. Modular design and integration with contemporary report generation and visualization systems allow feeding the visualization subsystems with data. Interactive data visualization systems establish two-way communication with the computational subsystems and provide excellent interfaces for filtering and extracting results and metrics. This research focuses on ways of extending the input data of an analyzer to support retail businesses transactions as well. The key clicks of the web application users are being substituted by sensor input, automatically generated by mobile applications that are activated by retail customers transaction data while the customer is visiting the shopping floor and searches through the aisles of the shopping floor for products. A sensor mobile device environment is particularly cheap, easy to integrate and useful, especially in situations where the retailer operates electronic shopping applications in parallel, selling online the same products that are being offered on the shelves. Like most web applications and services, e-commerce applications are often implemented without significant built-in subsystems and modules acting as internal performance measuring mechanisms. Developers constantly strive to program as efficiently as they can, using the best and fastest possible run-time optimization techniques and tools and optimize their code as well as they can. Other than that, overall performance measurement is not a primary responsibility of the programmers. The reason lies mainly in the fact that performance of web applications happens to be heavily dependent on the environment characteristics they operate in. These environments are usually complex, and consist of servers and various network connections, as well as services that happen to be distributed externally, often in other countries, like payment portals and security certificates. Thus, measurements need to be designed in a way that extends beyond the core software application implemented by the developer team whose main goal is to fulfill the functional requirements of the designers. Because responsiveness is always a major factor, since high revenue is sought for in all e-commerce applications, it is important to perform these measurements well and accurately. Occasionally overall response times increase and the administrators responsible often lack the means to even notice that. To remedy such conditions, it is crucial to have a precise performance, user-action and behavior measuring and visualizing system on hand, that will make all bottlenecks and problems visible and will even predict shortage of resources. Techniques used for obtaining operational and transactional data and presenting them on time to monitor the safe operation of any web site, and particularly an e-commerce site are presented in this work. Innovative ideas range from log file data enhancement techniques to real time visualization and customer behavioral pattern analysis. A customizable and extendable log file analyzer has been developed. During the development phase, four distinctive versions of the Analyzer Application have been produced. They can be used interchangeably according to the operational environment in scrutiny. These versions are being presented as steps of development in detail in the current document. They can be viewed as complementary functionalities. Important requirements for the software developer are ease of installation, integration, configuration and tuning. Portability across operating environments and possibility of combining cross platform installations lead to using 100% Java as a developed platform. This way, evaluating any e-commerce application becomes easy for the administrators. Issues involved in creating a prototype customizable e-commerce log file analyzer for measuring customer access to E-shops are pointed out and solutions provided. The analyzer is basically a toolbox, consisting of a set of the necessary tools to load the necessary data into its database and provide exact insight for customer access and system response of e-shops. Insight can be obtained through generation of extensive reporting, graphical reports and various visuals and statistics. The analyzer provides answers to standard questions such as: How many times has a specific product been added to the cart over a period? What is the average, maximum or minimum duration of visits? How many bytes were sent from the web server per day? What is the average duration of a complete payment cycle? How many customers have visited the site in a specified time span? How much revenue do we make per day or per hour? However, it provides answers to more interesting questions on session analysis such as what the customer route within the web application was, which web pages or selections are only seldom visited and the profile characteristics of the visitors. Additionally, comparisons between different e-shops and comparisons with previous years, months and days are feasible and easy, as is error reporting and detection as well. Our first approach of this research is based on the first four steps of the Quantitative Analysis Cycle of an E-business Site: 1. Insight of e-business site architecture 2. Measuring system performance from different reference points 3. Understanding customer behavior by generating a Customer Behavior Model Graph 4. Workload and Session analysis. The final approach is providing a platform that will promote: 5. Performance model development 6. Performance parameter definition 7. Workload forecasting 8. Prediction of site performance. The e-shop log file analysis tool can transparently display user actions and allow management to locate weak spots of the e-shop design, since it provides information about all user selected paths before a successful purchase or even an unsuccessful purchase attempt. It allows measurement", "year": 2020}

Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior and Elaboration Likelihood Model", "abstract": "Understanding generational differences in tourist behaviors helps in predicting and realizing future tourism trends. The new tourism market will be dominated by Digital Natives who have high expectations for technology and a more customized travel experience. In this vein, positive online reviews, suggestions, and recommendations provided by social media influencers (SMIs) help improve tourists' perception of tourism services and destinations, strengthen brand image, drive tourists' behavioral change, and increase tourism services sales. This research is designed to investigate the influence of SMIs on travel behavioral intention among the Digital Natives 2.0, people born after 1990, in Egypt. Through integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion and Theory of Planned Behavior, the study investigates the influences of the central route, argument quality, and the peripheral route, attractiveness, and credibility, on the attitude towards tourism SMIs which further affects the behavioral intention of Digital Natives 2.0 to travel to destinations endorsed by SMIs. Besides, the influence of subjective norms and perceived behavior control on behavioral intention are examined. Data is collected from 391 respondents, and the PLS-SEM technique is utilized to test the study hypotheses. The results supported that argument quality, attractiveness, and credibility are fundamental factors shaping Digital Natives 2.0 attitude towards tourism SMIs. Significantly, these three factors together predict 77.4% of the variation in the attitude towards tourism SMIs. Moreover, the study's model predicts 45.3% of Digital Natives 2.0 behavioral intention to travel to destinations endorsed by SMIs in Egypt. This makes social media influencers highly relevant for this market segment's travel decisionmaking. This research suggests that Egypt's tourism public and private sectors cannot afford to ignore the SMIs as an effective marketing tool for influencing domestic tourists' behavioral intention, especially Digital Natives 2.0, who represent more than 30% of total social media users in Egypt.

Survey of applications using Taiwan\u2019s open data in the time of coronavirus disease 2019", "abstract": "Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had spread rapidly since late December 2019. Personal protective equipment was essential to prevent transmission. Owing to shortage of face masks, Taiwan government began to implement quasi rationing on February 6, 2020, by allowing each resident to purchase two masks in seven days. Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration offered online data with real-time updates on face mask availability in all contracted pharmacies and selected local health centers. Based on the open data, numerous software applications quickly emerged to assist the public in finding sales locations efficiently. Methods: Up until March 15, 2020, the Public Digital Innovation Space of Taiwan government had recorded 134 software applications of face mask availability, and 24 software applications were excluded due to defect, duplicate, and unavailability. These applications were analyzed according to platform, developer type, and display mode. Results: Of the 110 valid software applications, 67 (60.9%) applications were deployed on websites, followed by 21 (19.1%) on social networking sites, 19 (17.3%) as mobile applications, and 3 (2.7%) in other modes. Nearly two thirds (n = 70) of applications were developed by individuals, one third (n = 37) by commercial companies, only two applications by central and local governments, and one by a nongovernmental organization. With respect to the display mode, 47 (42.7%) applications adopted map-view only, 41 (37.3%) adopted table-view only, and 19 (17.3%) adopted both modes. Of the remaining three applications, two offered voice user interfaces and one used augmented reality. Conclusion: Taiwan\u2019s open data strategy facilitated rapid development of software applications for information dissemination to the public during the COVID-19 crisis. The transparency of real-time data could help alleviate the panic of the public. The collaborative contributions from the grassroots in disasters were priceless treasures.", "year": 2020}

However due to their complexity, matters concerning urban systems present significant challenges to communicative and collaborative engagement activities in practice. This article provides a case study of interaction design led communication, knowledge sharing and collaboration on sustainable and open urban transport systems. It presents novel interactive online and offline formats that aimed to incite comprehension, critique and ideation activities for broad audiences despite the complexity involved. Namely, it shares learnings from the creation and application of an online taxonomy as well as a printable card deck created in alignment with interaction design principles. The dual formats are found to be useful tools that could be utilized in education, policy making, consultation and innovation fields as part of solution finding processes for the increasingly complex digitization challenges facing cities and societies. INTRODUCTION Cities are becoming increasingly complex in theory and practice. Digitization of public and private space, governance and across industries, underpinned by dynamic local to global networks and actors, are deepening the complexity of cities as objects of inquiry and contexts for action. The science of cities (Batty 2012, 2018) presents evolving dynamics, actors, relations, flows and multi-dimensional scales whose scenarios are difficult to model and coupled with uncertainty. Conceptualizing cities requires consideration of changes underway in their various interdependent systems within systems, including transport, energy, food, land use and population, which are each in turn constantly in flux (Baynes 2009). Indeed, the complexity of cities appears to be overtaking our ability to comprehend (Batty 2018). The long-established problem of not being able to precisely define what a city comprises has conflated The City and Complexity \u2013 Life, Design and Commerce in the Built Environment City, University of London , AMPS, Architecture_MPS London: 17-19 June, 2020 with new technology infused dimensions. This heightens the importance of finding new ways of thinking and learning about cities to further develop our \u2018spatial imaginations\u2019 (Healy 2006, 2007). Novel tools and perspectives for city makers and inhabitants are needed for communication, learning and collaboration so that multi-stakeholder strategies and solutions can be formulated and implemented that align transformations underway with sustainability. One approach to address the communicative and collaborative barriers provided by complexity is the employment of design. Specifically, interaction design principles applied in human computer interaction (HCI) praxis can be utilised to mediate urban systems complexity to enable stakeholder comprehension. This paper provides evidence that interaction design led communication and collaboration is a useful means for enabling understanding, interest and engagement. The case study activities concerned urban transport systems, however the overarching design principles applied could assist in inciting engagement in any topic riddled with complexity whereby broad public engagement, facilitation of learning, interdisciplinary dialogue, problem solving, or ideation are sought. COLLABORATION IN CITY MAKING Communicative and collaborative practice has a longstanding history in urban planning, public policy and architecture (Presscott 2000). With governance transitions, devolving government and diversifying service providers (Kearns and Paddison 2000), collaboration has become a staple of political rhetoric with a fluid meaning (O\u2019Flynn 2008). The term is used to represent many different types of working together, including networking, coordination, cooperation and collective decision making (Himmelman 2002, Esteban 2020). Looking past semantics, ideally collaboration is voluntary, involves mutual engagement and goal setting, autonomy and trust (Sullivan & Skelcher 2002). Considerable research attention has been paid to issues of collaboration. Healy (i.e. 1999, 2003) has extensively examined the implications of communicative acts and power structures in urban planning process. Mantho (2018) examines the issue of trust and the negation of self in collaboration in architecture. Margerum (2011) provides methods for public management that might bridge the gap between consensus building and implementation, whilst Huxham (2003) outlines problems and unrealized opportunities of collaboration within the themes of common aims, power, membership structures and leadership. Others highlight the difficulties in interdisciplinary and public collaboration due to heterogenous backgrounds of participants, and the multitude of perspectives involved making consensus difficult (Moirano et al 2020, Malhotra et al 2017). Nevertheless, the interdisciplinary and complex nature of contemporary societal challenges requires yet greater collaboration and joint working. The wicked problems of cities such as housing affordability and uneven economic development, as well as climate change and the sustainability of urban systems require new linkages between previously siloed actors, institutions and enterprises (Crowley & Head 2017, Davidson & Gleeson 2017, Fab City 2019). Vertical collaboration for multilevel governance as well as horizontal collaboration across industries and sectors are integral for the accomplishment of global sustainable development goals (Vazquez-Brust et al 2020), particularly in terms of enabling innovation. INTERACTION DESIGN FOR COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENT Whilst city making and governance have increasingly pursued stakeholder engagement and collaboration, ubiquitous computing has transformed dominant means of information dissemination and communication norms. With declining faith in institutional authorities, the world wide web has provided an almost paralysing number of sources and formats, making information overload a modern-day problem (Dhavan et al 2017). This abundance has created a struggle to attract and retain attention (Franck 2018). The City and Complexity \u2013 Life, Design and Commerce in the Built Environment City, University of London , AMPS, Architecture_MPS London: 17-19 June, 2020 The speed and volume of digitally mediated content and interactions have added new dimensions to notions of participation and collaboration. Whereas referring to in-person engagement would assume a two-way conversation or marked exchange between parties, engagement in digital terms refers to milliseconds of a person\u2019s attention, a fleeting moment of recognition. Decades of \u2018digitality\u2019 are creating a new type of cognitive space (Negroponte 1995) and this environment calls for new types of thinking and learning (McKenzie 2019). Juxtaposed with the complexity of cities, these are challenging trends for urban practitioners and others seeking wide communication, engagement and collaboration in city making activities. In light of these transformations, the utilisation of interaction design within human-computer interaction (HCI) best practice is one-way communication and collaboration could be oriented in the pursuit of optimal engagement. The goal of interaction design is to create a positive user experience, commonly with interfaces for software and websites, but principles of interaction design are also applied with non-digital products. Interaction design is increasingly used to incite emotion with physical products (and the will to purchase) or to actively engage audiences in gaming, social media or online shopping (Chong 2018, Salmond & Ambrose 2015). To apply interaction design principles to collaborative or communicative practice, participants are considered the users, and the collaboration action or communication output replaces the digital media or physical artefact for interaction design intervention. Best practice principles of interaction design set out by Heim (2008) are identified hereafter. The principles are explained in terms of how they relate or could be applied to collaboration and communication activities in urban practice to unravel complexity and enhance engagement of participants.", "year": 2020}

Thus, this paper proposes a novel virtual assembly system integrating multi-sensory channels, including gesture interaction, Chinese speech interaction, tactile interaction, 3D display and real-time display of real environment pictures in the virtual environment. To improve the operability of the virtual environment, we analyze the parallel virtual assembly sequence on the basis of two-hand interaction, and the assembly priority is prompted based on UI interface. For ease of operation, we present a method of viewpoint control based on gesture interaction and the coordinate threshold of spatial position. A hierarchical bounding box collision detection algorithm based on volume difference is proposed to improve the efficiency of collision feedback and collision avoidance. In addition, the power equipment models are exhibited in the virtual scene, as the exhibits of the virtual roaming process.

{"paperId": "bc4cd971bec93ff1037225b0731bd9f8c86fb99c", "title": "Editorial", "abstract": "One of the key factors which distinguishes Behaviour & Information Technology (BIT) from other journals concerned with the interaction of people with computer technology is that we are unashamedly human-centred. We are interested in technology, not for its own sake, but for the way it enhances and supports people in their work and lives. Over the past 35 or so years that BIT has been publishing in this area, my perception is that human-centredness has moved from being a tolerated facet of technology to being one of the main reasons for its success. The success of Apple has shown that making technology more humancentred is good for business. Of course, every so often there is concern that Apple\u2019s \u2018bubble has burst\u2019 and we recently saw its lower iPhone sales result in an 18% fall in revenue in the second quarter of 2016. Before we panic too much, its iPhone revenue fell to $32.9 billion from $40.3 billion last year. That is still a lot of iPhones in a world where it is hard to walk along the road in the UK without seeing someone with one stuck to their ear! But even if Apple\u2019s fortunes are shrinking slightly, its focus on the user and the user\u2019s experience is here to stay. The competitors who are hard on its heels are actually causing it problems because they are playing its own game. Human-centred technology is widely regarded as the way to design usable systems. I have previously mentioned my other \u2018hobby\u2019 (apart from BIT) which involves international standards on human\u2013system interaction. I am proud to have been the project editor of ISO 9241-210, the Human-Centred Design standard published in 2010 as an update on our 1999 standard of the same name (but a different number ISO 13407). These standards have been widely accepted in industries as diverse as web design, mobile technology and even defence (where ISO 9241-210 is referenced and recommended in DefStan 00250 \u2013 a key UK military procurement standard). Noting this acceptance, we decided to see if we could apply the concept of human-centredness, not just to design processes but to the whole organisation. With strong international support from across the world, we have developed a newly published International Standard ISO 27500:2016 The Human-centred Organisation \u2013 Rationale and General Principles. I am pleased to have been joint project leader with Tomas Berns from Sweden, who is also a long standing board member for BIT. The standard is aimed at executive board members and explains the values and beliefs that make an organisation human-centred, the significant business and operational benefits that can be achieved, and the policies they need to put in place to achieve this. The standard identifies seven principles which characterise a human-centred organisation:", "year": 2016}

Based on the perspective of QFD, this paper explores the mechanism and characteristics of value reengineering of chain retail enterprises' supply chain from three aspects: the process procurement chain, the improvement of logistics financial profit model and social media marketing channels. In order to improve the supply chain operation mode of the original chain retail enterprises, promote the retail enterprises to better dock the market, optimize the product sales mode and enhance the user experience, it has an important role in promoting the chain retail enterprises to enhance the soft power of the supply chain. 1. Conceptual analysis of qfd Quality Function Deployment (QFD), also known as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), is a multi-level deductive analysis method (Lin, 2014), which converts consumer or market demand into product design requirements, component characteristics and product production requirements through user-driven, and then guarantees product quality development. QFD embodies the idea of taking market specific demand as the orientation and consumer demand as the sole basis for product production. QFD technology occupies an important position in the complete framework of production and development design methods, and is the leading link for commodity developers to carry out product quality planning. Through QFD technology, enterprises can make decisions on the key links and components of product development and design, and then determine the specific implementation object and direction of product development and design. By using QFD technology, enterprises can establish a close relationship between product R&D activities and consumer needs, thus effectively enhance product market competitiveness and ensure that products can fully meet consumer needs (Yan, 2013). Investigation and analysis of consumer demand is the initial input of QFD, and the final output is the terminal product to meet market demand (Lu, 2012). Product output mainly depends on consumer satisfaction, so it is important to correctly understand and analyze consumer demand for the implementation of QFD. Relevance matrix is the basic tool to develop QFD. The idea of implementing QFD as a whole can be described by the waterfall decomposition model. The key link of QFD implementation is to obtain consumer demand, and subdivide consumer demand information into all aspects of product production, further transform demand information into technical and quality control requirements of product production, to meet consumer demand. When decomposing the consumer demand information, the information can be divided into four stages: product technical characteristics, product parts characteristics, product process characteristics and product quality control methods, so as to formulate product production planning, production planning and product quality improvement plan for manufacturers, and provide decision support for enterprise product production. 2. Problems of value creation in supply chain of traditional chain retail enterprises First, the quality of supply chain logistics is low. Low cost and high efficiency are the key to improve the market competitiveness of retail enterprises. High quality logistics distribution system 2019 4th International Symposium on Management, Economics, E-business and Marketing (ISMEEM 2019) Copyright \u00a9 (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/ismeem.2019.026 135 and efficient distribution system are the important guarantee for chain retail enterprises to reduce circulation costs and improve operational efficiency (Li, 2014). According to the survey, about 20% of chain retail enterprises have not yet established distribution channels suiTable for the internal development of enterprises, while the remaining 80% of chain retail enterprises even have distribution centers, but the automation level of distribution centers has not reached the high efficiency standard (Qian, 2016). At the same time, the problems of small distribution scale, backward facilities and incomplete functions directly affect the development and expansion of enterprises (Cheng, 2018). Second, the market position is not clear. At present, China's chain retail enterprises operate in the same category, price and store layout, lack of corresponding characteristics, resulting in the same region, the same grade and the same type of chain retail enterprises fierce competition bureau (Luo and Wang, 2016). The competition among chain retail enterprises still stays in price competition. Most of them focus on immediate interests and do not establish business characteristics for the long-term development of enterprises. As a result, the internal management and management of enterprises lack innovation, and even seriously imitate peer enterprises, which makes it difficult to improve the business performance of enterprises. Third, the operation of chain retail enterprises is not standardized. At present, many retail enterprises in China are chain-like, but they cannot really achieve unification. Chain retail enterprises cannot achieve centralized purchasing and relatively decentralized operation. Therefore, there is no built-in economic link system among the chain stores, which makes the competition between the chain stores uncoordinated and leads to the disintegration of the chain stores. 3. Support links of supply chain value reengineering for chain retail enterprises based on qfd On the basis of the above analysis, this paper carries out value reengineering of chain retail enterprises supply chain based on QFD, mainly focusing on the procurement, logistics and marketing links of the supply chain of retail enterprises. We strive to upgrade and optimize the traditional supply chain model in the process of supply chain value reengineering of chain retail enterprises, and further improve and break through the relevant links on the basis of improving the service and product quality of chain retail enterprises. 3.1 Processing Purchasing Chain Chain retail enterprises involve a wide variety of products and materials procurement, which makes it difficult to form large-scale and orderly operating benefits, and the value of procurement has been difficult to play. Therefore, based on QFD, starting from the internal procurement department of chain retail enterprises, to achieve product procurement and management is also the best way to develop the supply chain of chain retail enterprises in the future, and it is also an important link to seamlessly connect the procurement link with the supply chain.Chain retail enterprise procurement is divided into two parts: procurement center and subsidiary procurement department. Purchasing process of purchasing center mainly adopts inquiry, index and single purchasing method, unifies purchasing products and formulates purchasing plan according to the attributes of bulk or major materials. Then the procurement plan or tender report will be submitted to the head of the procurement center for examination and approval. After approval, the procurement task will continue to be completed, and be responsible for tracking the arrival of goods, inspection of goods, payment and warehousing, etc., without passing back to the requisition department. The subsidiary procurement department is mainly proposed by the retail enterprise demand department, filling in the procurement demand form and sending it to the procurement department for review. In the case of bulk or important materials, the subsidiary departments need to report to the procurement center, which is responsible for the procurement. If it is small-scale goods, it is necessary to ask for purchase materials according to actual needs, and then enter the procurement process after approval by the procurement center. In the supply chain procurement process of retail enterprises, the purchasing department of retail enterprises is subdivided. The purchasing center is responsible for purchasing bulk or important materials whose prices change", "year": 2019}

Mouse hover is a vital interaction method for users to access shopping sites and significantly impacts their decision-making experience. A well-designed mouse hover function can effectively enhance the user's search performance and improve the user experience. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the dynamic prompt designs at the hover position and the degree of feedback transparency may affect the user's task performance and personal feelings when operating the hover function on the shopping website.Design/methodology/approachThe study employed two independent variables in the experiments: dynamic prompt and background transparency of hover feedback. A between-subject design of 2 (single flicker and continuous flicker)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 (transparency at 0%, 25%, and 50%) was adopted in the experiment. A total of 60 participants were invited to participate in the experiment using the purposive sampling method. Participants were asked to complete four operation tasks, and the time of each was recorded. They were then asked to complete the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire and conduct subjective evaluations before they were briefly interviewed.FindingsThe generated results revealed that: (1) In the interaction with a shopping website, the degree of background transparency of hover feedback affected the participants' task performance.

However, the effect of new government media is not good. The operation mode of Internet celebrity has a significant impact on enhancing the communication power, credibility and influence of new government media. Therefore, based on the operation mode of Internet celebrities, this paper proposes to establishing the awareness of serving fans, creating a charismatic and personalized image, outputting functional and strategic content, promoting emotional interaction with the public and strengthening trust. During the prevalence of COVID-19, Zhong Nanshan spoke on behalf of the \"mainstream Internet celebrities\", and Doctor Zhang Wenhong was also sought after by netizens for his personality and professional expression. Their opinions, guiding force, credibility and influence are far greater than many traditional media and new government media. This reflects the great role of the key opinion leaders of online celebrities. This paper discusses the communication innovation of new government media through this phenomenon. 1. The concept and development of new government media As of March 2020, \"the number of Internet users in China has reached 904 million, and the Internet penetration rate has reached 64.5%. The scale of mobile Internet users is 897 million, and 99.3% of China's Internet users use mobile phones to access the Internet. \" This shows that the public access to information from traditional media to new media. In order to adapt to the development of mobile Internet, build a service-oriented government and explore a new model of social governance, the party and the government practice the online mass line and promote the development of new media for government affairs. The government new media refers to \"government accounts or applications opened on microblog, wechat and other third-party platforms by administrative organs at all levels, institutions undertaking administrative functions and their internal institutions, as well as mobile clients developed and constructed by themselves.\". All localities and departments are actively building the government new media. According to the report from Tiktok, \"by the end of 2019, the government of all levels had launched 82937 headlines and 17380 voice signals.\" the government has more than 500 thousand public accounts for micro-blog. \" The government new media has become an important network channel for the party and the government to contact, serve and unite the masses. However, there is a big gap between the operation effect of different accounts of government new media.\" According to tiktok account analysis report, the government accounts and the other voice accounts of other networks in the same period show that: \"the number of government fans is less, concentrated in the interval below 100 thousand, the number of works is less, concentrated in the interval below 100, and the number of praise is also concentrated in the tiktok below 1 million.\"The head of the network red general fans more than 10 million, waist network red general fans more than one million. It reflects the operational efficiency and efficiency of many government affairs number. In addition to the differences in government attention and investment, there are three operational reasons. First, some government new media have not yet established the service awareness of optimizing user experience, which is reflected in slow response and insincere expression.Second, 2020 3rd International Conference on e-Education, e-Business and Information Management (EEIM 2020) Published by CSP \u00a9 2020 the Authors 21 some government new media only provide information release services. Third, some new government media can not balance the authority of content with the intimacy of expression. 2. Online celebrity and its operation mode Internet celebrity is defined in a narrow sense as \"Internet celebrity\" (Yin Jun, Zhang Yueyue, Ao Peng, Zheng Wencong, etc., 2016).In fact, online celebrities may not refer to people. Cartoon characters, robots and animals may become Internet Celebrities. In general, Rahman (2004) thinks that it is a symbol system.Bielby (1995) and others think that it is a kind of \"complex cultural construction\".This paper holds that the Internet red as a noun refers to \"based on Internet communication and widely concerned with the personality of cultural symbols.\u201d A technology or a series of practices defined by Theresa senft and Marwick refers to the technology and method of becoming Internet Celebrities. In this paper, it is called \"online celebrity operation mode\", which is defined as: in the network media, through a series of planning and design, content production, image promotion and technical management, to form a set of methods that are widely concerned and establish stable fans&apos; personalized cultural symbols. As a methodology, online celebrity operation mode can not only cultivate network celebrities, but also be used for the operation of new government media accounts, so as to improve the communication, credibility and influence of new government media. Public attention has been paid to the online popularity of government affairs. The deputy county magistrate of Xinjiang Yuli County Kwai Kwai has successfully collected 250 thousand fans from the national policy, and Li Hai Ming, deputy director of Weixian County Public Security Bureau of Hebei, has set up a \"Weixian County visiting\" quick fan live broadcast fan number of 930 thousand. According to tiktok tiktok economic observation data, in 2020 2-3, 16 secretaries and county leaders sold 550 thousand agricultural products through the jowl and watermelon live video broadcast, with sales exceeding 21 million yuan.However, there is no simple way for government officials to create a live broadcast system with red media.This paper holds that the Enlightenment of online celebrity operation mode to new government media includes three aspects 2.1 Stabilize the output of content and continue to attract attention Internet Celebrities can get more attention.Goethe Heber pointed out that \"Information is abundant or even surplus, and the scarce resources are not information, but people's attention.\" Attention refers to the ability of people's senses, consciousness, thinking and psychology to point to and focus on a certain object. However, the Internet red is not a one-time, but a period of time to be widely noticed. Only by being noticed continuously for a period of time can we implant the mentality of netizens and become the image of Internet Celebrities. For example tiktok of Beijing anti terrorist and SWAT general headquarters launched the video entitled \"the Beijing anti terrorist special police is officially jitter\", using the theme music of the popular games wilderness action as background music, displaying the training of the SWAT team members daily, , gaining about 8000000 tiktok and more than 180 thousand comments, becoming a network phenomenon, but the subsequent output appeal. 2.2 Establish a brand with identification and value Internet Celebrities is a brand, which is recognized, remembered, associated and liked by netizens. Brand is the cognition and evaluation of a subject (enterprise, product, city, character) formed in its corresponding object mind, reflecting its difference and value. The formation of a brand name for a new media account means that the majority of netizens can recognize it, and when they see this account, they can associate their differences and values, and they are interested in using this account. The establishment of new government media brand also needs analysis, planning, positioning, design, packaging, promotion, and establish continuous connection with the public through stable content output, expand attention and enlarge influence through specific event communication, and form a good concept in the public mind.", "year": 2020}

Providing individuals with concrete feedback on their current behavior has been shown to foster sustainable behavior. So far, research on the real-world impact and underlying mechanisms of such IS-enabled interventions is scarce. In a randomized controlled field experiment with 1,423 participants, we systematically test the effect of different intervention strategies regarding their impact on energy consumption and user experience. We find a conservation effect of over 18% for the best treatment. In particular, the results suggest that small, seemingly harmless variations of IS design choices regarding numerical, normative, or emotional feedback can considerably affect behavioral outcomes (energy use). Potential explanations of observed behavior are given based on theories from psychology. The study delivers design implications for innovative IS artifacts that highlight the importance and necessity of taking cognitive processes into account. Real-World Impact of Information Systems Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Seoul, Korea 2017 2 Introduction Understanding the contribution of IS on work performance has been one of the core research interests of the community from its start. Today, in the ages of exponentially growing computing power and easy-to-use sensors at negligible costs, IS are also increasingly entering our private lives, in which smartphones, personal computers, or many other devices have become indispensable (Baskerville 2011; Hess et al. 2014). The role of IS and the circumstances that shape the adoption and usage of IS in these non-professional contexts are fundamentally different from organizational settings. Beyond the application of IS to fulfil economic needs, idiosyncratic and social needs of individuals gain in importance (Baskerville 2011). Aside from facilitating processes (e.g. smart thermostats, live traffic information) or providing entertainment (e.g., games, social media), privately used information systems (PIS) may serve as a platform for data-based interventions in real-time. So-called persuasive technologies \u2013 designed to support behavior change \u2013 can support the individual\u2019s capabilities and decision making (Corbett 2013), helping them to disrupt habits and supporting the pursuit of individual (e.g., physical activity, health) or societal goals (e.g., sustainability) (Hermsen et al. 2016). While IS scholars have developed theoretical frameworks that explicitly address the adoption also of PIS (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology), research that investigates the practical impact and contribution of such technologies to societal problems is still scarce (Gholami et al. 2016). In fact, leading IS scholars increasingly stress the importance of empirical evidence and call for conducting real-world impact studies that contribute to pressing societal issues, in particular to the 17 sustainable development goals put forward by the United Nations, of which many focus on environmental sustainability (Agarwal and Dhar 2014; Agerfalk 2014; Beath et al. 2013; Gupta 2017; Rai 2017; Sawyer and Winter 2011). While the Green IS community in particular seeks to address this, recent meta-analyses point out a strong propensity to conceptualizing and analyzing studies and identify a lack of empirical designand impactoriented contributions (Gholami et al. 2016; Malhotra et al. 2013). In particular, studies that Real-World Impact of Information Systems Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Seoul, Korea 2017 3 establish a link between the design (content, framing, representation) of an IS artifact and its actual impact on resource consumption or carbon emissions are missing. Yet research conducted in other disciplines (environmental psychology, behavioral economics) highlight how even seemingly small changes to the content or framing of behavioral interventions can have large implications on their real-world impact (Hardisty et al. 2010; Schultz et al. 2007, 2015). With findings from a randomized controlled field experiment with 1,423 hotel guests we contribute to the current state of research in four ways: First, we roll-out a persuasive technology and quantify consumer behavior in a real-world setting. Further, we confirm the large influencing potential of data-based interventions by finding a large treatment effect on the target behavior of over 18% for the most successful treatment condition. Next, we systematically vary the content of the intervention and show that seemingly harmless variations can have a detrimental impact on resource conservation. Last, we map the results to theories from cognitive psychology to (potentially) explain the observed behavior. The results indicate the importance of carefully choosing the design based on a well-grounded development of IS and of providing a detailed artifact description. Related Work and Research Gap In 2010, Melville called for research on the impact of different IS design choices on sustainable behavior. A recent meta-review (Gholami et al. 2016) identified a single impact-oriented study (Loock et al. 2013). While research in psychology (e.g., Schultz et al. 2007), behavioral economics (e.g., Ferraro and Price 2013), and Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) (Froehlich et al. 2010, 2012) suggests the importance of artifact design choices on resulting consumer behavior, many IS studies (for instance on technology adoption) do not provide a detailed description of the artifact investigated (Barnett et al. 2015; Venkatesh et al. 2012). Hence, it is conceivable that results on the adoption, use, or impact of an IS artifact are strongly influenced by particular design choices that are not even mentioned in those articles. Real-World Impact of Information Systems Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Seoul, Korea 2017 4 A research community that explicitly investigates such issues is HCI. Several HCI studies have evaluated user interfaces of feedback devices regarding user experience and expected outcomes; yet, a meta-study by Froehlich et al. (2010) identifies methodological flaws in HCI studies which make it challenging to draw valid conclusions: they do not measure behavioral outcomes, or lack reference data (control group or pre-intervention data). More recent studies in the HCI community are also not able to establish correlations of visualized content and outcomes in terms of energy consumption; they rely on intentions rather than studying usage (Froehlich et al. 2012), do not quantify behavior change (Hargreaves et al. 2013), or have small sample sizes that yield statistically insignificant results and do not allow for valid inference (Rettie et al. 2014). Feedback studies in behavioral economics or psychology, on the other hand, typically feature a research design that allows to gauge the impact of IS-enabled sustainability interventions. A plethora of studies investigate how websites or in-home displays with feedback on household electricity use affect conservation behavior and recent meta-studies report conservation effects of 0-5% (Delmas et al. 2013; McKerracher and Torriti 2013). Providing feedback on a single, energy-intensive activity like showering, can lead to saving effects of 22% for the target behavior which translated into 5% of the participants\u2019 household energy use (Tiefenbeck et al. forthcoming). However, the findings of all these studies are the outcome of a whole bundle of different IS design choices, with different content elements provided in parallel (e.g., energy use in kWh, financial savings, neighborhood comparisons). Thus, the influence of an individual element (e.g. energy use in kWh) on consumption behavior remains unknown. The only exception we are aware of is a recent experiment that investigated the impact of feedback on electricity use alone vs. in combination with associated costs vs. in combination with social norms (Schultz et al. 2015). Only the latter treatment yields a significant treatment effect (of 9% after 1-week and 7% after 3-months). Real-World Impact of Information Systems Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Seoul, Korea 2017 5 In short, there is a lack of studies that investigate systematically the path from information provision to engagement to actual impact on behavior. Understanding the relationship between IS design choices (feedback elements) and behavioral outcomes would be of high value for both, advancing theory and building more effective interventions in practice. In this article, we will use real-world measurement data to systematically investigate to what extent individual design choices may affect sustainable consumer behavior. Research Method and Hypotheses In a 6-months randomized controlled field trial in cooperation with a hotel in Germany, we equipped 40 hotel rooms with smart shower meters and collected data on each shower (water volume, temperature, and flowrate of each shower). We examine showering as target behavior for two reasons: First, it is a frequent and self-contained activity where the resource consumption is the outcome of an individual\u2019s daily decision-making and behavior. Second, beyond its impact on water resources, showering accounts for more than 80% of the total energy used for water heating in the residential sector (Bertrand et al. 2017), which in turn is the second largest energy end use in European and U.S. households (iea 2016). The exact amount of energy used for a shower is a product of used water and temperature; for our data analysis later on, we will use energy consumption as a dependent variable. The devices installed display feedback on the ongoing shower on a little screen located between shower hose and shower head at the user\u2019s eye level and store data on every shower taken.

{"paperId": "c0c6bea30b6dfab677173f5d2dbd66612161ad9b", "title": "Risks and Benefits of Marijuana Use", "abstract": "Marijuana is legal in 30 states and the District of Columbia for medicinal purposes and in 8 states for recreational use (1). These legal changes have been accompanied by an increase in daily marijuana use, as well as in marijuana dependence, among adults in the U.S. population (2). Further, the prevalence of past-year marijuana use in the adult general population doubled in the past decade, reaching 13.3% in 2014 (3). With legalization of recreational marijuana, rapid commercialization has ensued. Retail marijuana sales exceed $1 billion annually in Colorado and Washington, the first 2 states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes (4, 5). Extensive media coverage of the business, agricultural, and financial aspects of recreational legalization may be desensitizing the public to safety concerns (6, 7). Marijuana is being described on the Internet as a product that may be consumed safely during pregnancy; a product with preventive benefits that improves indices of metabolism, such as glucose and lipid levels; and a potential cure for cancer (8, 9). Whereas the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to consumers is heavily regulated, promotion of marijuana products has no such constraints. Mass marketing of marijuana to the public has not been accompanied by public health messages about the potential risks of these products, because the evidence base describing both benefits and harms is limited (10, 11). In the past few years, a substantial effort has been made to identify the risks and benefits of marijuana, as well as the gaps in evidence. Several recent systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for treating musculoskeletal pain and low-strength evidence that marijuana use is effective in managing neuropathic pain (12). A recent meta-analysis concluded that heavy cannabis use increases the risk for psychotic outcomes and that there is sufficient evidence to justify harm reduction prevention programs (13). Although low-strength evidence suggests that marijuana smoking is associated with cough and sputum production, data are insufficient regarding how daily marijuana use might affect long-term physical health, including the effects of frequent or heavy use on cardiovascular outcomes (such as stroke and myocardial infarction), obstructive lung disease, pulmonary function, and cancer (14, 15). Available data are also insufficient on the effect of marijuana use among older persons and adults with chronic health conditions (12). Several studies reported neurocognitive risks with marijuana use, including effects on memory, attention, educational outcomes, and life satisfaction, as well as risk for dependence, but the evidence base is limited and debate continues on whether use in adolescence is associated with an irreversible adverse effect on IQ and cognition (16, 17). Emerging data suggest that marijuana may adversely affect treatment of depression and anxiety and that regular marijuana use is associated with emergency department visits and fatal vehicle crashes (16). Because of the dearth of data on the adverse consequences of marijuana use and the increasing availability of cannabis products, understanding how the public perceives marijuana use is important (11). National surveys suggest that the perception of great risk from weekly marijuana use dropped from 50.4% in 2002 to 33.3% in 2014 (3). However, we have little understanding of public perceptions of other domains of marijuana use, including specific risks and benefits, potential preventive health benefits, and societal effects (such as exposure to secondhand smoke and driving under the influence). In addition, we have little information on how Americans view marijuana compared with tobacco and alcohol, 2 commonly used substances for which decades of research has created a robust understanding of the potential risks. Finally, no data exist on how perceptions of risks and benefits may vary according to the history of marijuana use. We conducted a national survey to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the views of U.S. adults toward marijuana use to help public health leaders and state and federal policymakers improve communication regarding risks, benefits, and current gaps in knowledge. Methods Survey Development We reviewed existing federal surveys, peer-reviewed literature, and media reports to identify questions used to assess perceived risks and benefits of marijuana use (16, 1820). In addition, 2 of the authors (S.K and S.S.) interviewed professionals in various fields, including substance abuse and mental health experts, medical dispensary staff, and marijuana distributors, to understand forms of consumption and potential reasons for marijuana use among the public. On the basis of our review of existing national surveys, our literature review, interviews with professionals in the field, and the investigative team's experiences (including personal interaction with the public), we drafted survey items that focused on improving our understanding of the general public's views on marijuana and specifically addressed content areas not covered by federally sponsored surveys. These content areas included perceptions of specific risks and benefits of marijuana use, possible preventive health benefits of different methods of marijuana consumption (smoking, vaping, ingestion), addiction potential, safety of use during pregnancy, and societal effects (including secondhand smoke and driving under the influence). We also developed survey items to compare the perceived safety of marijuana versus alcohol and tobacco. The purpose of these questions was to gauge how Americans view the safety of daily use of marijuana relative to that of commonly used substances with a more established risk profile. The items were motivated partly by the team's observation (shared by other groups) that marijuana smoking and secondhand exposure to marijuana smoke are common and tolerated in certain areas of California (21). The survey also included items designed to capture forms of marijuana use, frequency of use, reasons for use, and knowledge and behaviors associated with use. Overall, 27 questions were designed to capture opinions and 54 to capture use. We designed the survey to include a spectrum of answer options to enable respondents to identify the statement most closely aligned with their beliefs. Because many of the questions did not have clear-cut, scientific answers, we specifically did not include an I don't know option to ensure that respondents chose a statement closest to their current views. Survey items and content were written at an eighth-grade level and tested with online software (22). Cognitive testing of the items was done with a convenience sample of 40 adults of different ages and education levels, including marijuana users and nonusers, to iteratively refine the content. Sampling Strategy To survey U.S. adults, we used Growth from Knowledge (GfK) KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally representative online panel of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population (23). Growth from Knowledge created KnowledgePanel by randomly sampling addresses. This address-based panel covers 97% of the United States and represents a statistical sample of the country's population. Households without Web access are provided with an Internet connection and a tablet to ensure participation. All panel members are sampled with a known probability of selection; no one can volunteer to participate. Sampling of participants was stratified by the legalization status (recreational, medical, or nonlegal) of their states to allow comparisons across states. We oversampled 2 groups (California residents and adults aged 18 to 26 years) to support additional research questions. Sampling weights were provided by GfK. Further details on KnowledgePanel's sampling strategy are provided at www.knowledgenetworks.com/knpanel/docs/knowledgepanel(R)-design-summary-description.pdf. Survey Administration The survey was piloted in a random sample of 20 participants to review and refine online administration. The Internet survey was launched on 27 September 2017 to 16280 U.S. adults aged 18 years and older. Data collection was completed on 9 October 2017. The Committee of Human Subject Research of the University of California, San Francisco, exempted GfK's conduct of the survey from review. Statistical Analysis and Weighting The response rate, determined by using methods outlined by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, was the ratio of respondents to all participants who received the survey (24). Growth from Knowledge provided final survey weights to account for oversampling of California residents and for nonresponse. Results were weighted by using weights provided by GfK to approximate the U.S. population on the basis of age, sex, race, ethnicity, education level, household income, home ownership, and metropolitan area. Respondents who did not answer all the questions were dropped from the analysis. All analyses used weighting commands based on variables provided by GfK to generate national estimates. To assess how well our sample correlated with federally sponsored surveys, we compared the sociodemographic characteristics of our respondents with those of participants in the 2015 National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health (NSDUH), which provides information on the epidemiology of substance abuse and marijuana use in the United States (18, 20). We combined responses to present views as appropriate. The decision to combine results was made at the design stage and was geared toward gauging the direction a respondent was leaning in his or her views. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all items, and results were categorized by time of last marijuana use and age. All analyses were performed with R statistical software, version R-3.4.0 (The R Foundation). Role of the Funding Source The funders played no role in the design, ", "year": 2018}

Research identifies trust as a major factor in this exchange. It concludes that seller-generated product descriptions can mitigate mistrust. Further, technical and professional communication research can reveal what content sellers tend to provide and can reveal how platform design may encourage that content. Literature review: C2C e-commerce and TPC researchers agree that mistrust can be mitigated by detailed content, and they call for platform designers to help improve platform and seller reputations. Research questions: 1. What content do sellers provide about their technical products? 2. How do the platforms' web form designs and the associated documentation about listing a product for sale encourage certain content types? Research methodology: Four platforms were chosen using specific criteria. Product descriptions were collected once per week for six weeks, generating 1900 product descriptions. These descriptions were unitized and given reliable content categories, a methodology called quantitative content analysis. Further, the documentation and processes for posting items were explored to determine how they may encourage content types. Results/discussion: Sellers mostly provide product information and sales procedures, and they rarely give benefits and goodwill to the buyer. The platform design seems to encourage this content because of the content-entry process, the content-entry options, and the required and unrequired content entry. Conclusions: This study invites technical and professional communicators to provide more guidelines for users about the kinds of content they may include, and designers to explore the content entry process using usability and user-experience research.", "year": 2019}

Despite their utility, data from both recent academic and market research have indicated high attrition rates of WAT users. Concurrently, evidence shows that social support (SS), delivered/obtained via social network services or sites (SNS), could increase adherence and engagement of PA intervention programs. To date, relatively few studies have looked at how WATs and SS may interact and affect PAs. Objective The purpose of this study was to explore how these two Internet and mobile technologies, WATs and SNS, could work together to foster sustainable PA behavior changes and habits among middle-aged adults (40-60 years old) in Taiwan. Methods We used purposive sampling of Executive MBA Students from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology to participate in our qualitative research. In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with a total of 15 participants, including 9 WAT users and 6 nonusers. Analysis of the collected materials was done inductively using the thematic approach with no preset categories. Two authors from different professional backgrounds independently annotated and coded the transcripts, and then discussed and debated until consensus was reached on the final themes. Results The thematic analysis revealed six themes: (1) WATs provided more awareness than motivation in PA with goal-setting and progress monitoring, (2) SS, delivered/obtained via SNS, increased users\u2019 adherence and engagement with WATs and vice versa, (3) a broad spectrum of configurations would be needed to deliver WATs with appropriately integrated SS functions, (4) WAT design, style, and appearance mattered even more than those of smartphones, as they are body-worn devices, (5) the user interfaces of WATs left a great deal to be desired, and (6) privacy concerns must be addressed before more mainstream consumers would consider adopting WATs. Conclusions Participants perceived WATs as an awareness tool to understand one\u2019s PA level. It is evident from our study that SS, derived from SNS and other pertinent vehicles such as the LINE social messaging application (similar to WhatsApp and WeChat), will increase the engagement and adherence of WAT usage. Combining WATs and SNS enables cost-effective, scalable PA intervention programs with end-to-end services and data analytics capabilities, to elevate WATs from one-size-fits-all consumer electronics to personalized PA assistants.", "year": 2016}

Many of these methodologies require qualitative studies with small groups of users based on set guidelines and are time and resource intensive. In this paper, we propose a new technique: \u201cUser Review Analysis\u201d that makes use of big data to uncover user needs. The technique consists of collecting and analyzing online User Reviews on shopping sites such as Amazon. The basic idea is that because of the fast and cyclic nature of consumer products development, reviews of Today\u2019s products inform designers on the next product generation. As the data is based on actual product-use experience with similar products, the aggregated insights provide product-in-use experience and brings to light several product design aspects and complement the existing methods. User Reviews; User-Centered Design Method; Product Experience; Currently, the relationship between designers and users is getting closer with increasing speed (Sanders & Stappers, 2008). In the past, industrial designers were focused on developing the physical object and considered users as customers. However, with UserCentered Design, the perspective towards users changed from passive consumers to experts of their experiences (Sanders, 2002). User Experience (UX) is defined as \u201ca person\u2019s perceptions and responses that result from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service\u201d according to ISO 9241-110:2010 (clause 2.15). Kujala (2009) argues that since UX offers information on user interactions with certain products, it should be considered from the start of the design process. Not only when to use the UX is important, but also how to use the UX within the process should be addressed. According to Sleeswijk Visser (2009), the product being studied only plays a minor role in the experiences of people in their everyday lives. People\u2019s experiences and interactions with a product are governed by the underlying situation and the context in which it is used. Therefore, she suggests studying the \u201ccontext of product use\u201d, which provides a more realistic perspective on user experiences from a holistic point of view. Analyzing user-generated contents including narratives, comments, pictures and other activity results is the key way to understanding user\u2019s context (Olsson & Salo, 2012; Korhonen et al., 2010). Some of the more well-known techniques conducted at the fuzzy front end of the design process are Focus Group, Contextual Inquiry, Interview and Contextmapping (Visser et al., 2005). These methods all support designers by providing information and inspiration for new product development. Although these methods are seen as essential in product design and commonly applied, they come with several limitations. Most of these methods require controlled environments, willing volunteers, copious amount of time, and a generous budget (Opdenakker, 2006). For research teams on a budget, these constraints unavoidably lead them to conduct their studies on a non-representative and insufficient subject pool. The lack of their dataset\u2019s general applicability could often lead to skewed information. However, the ongoing advances in information technology and online social platforms open up new avenues for such usergenerated experience data gathering. In the last few years, online shopping has become immensely popular and often hese online reviews (UR) people review and discuss the merchandise online (Chen & Xie, 2008). These online reviews (UR) include rich pool of data, including both positive and negative product experiences with existing products (Zhu & Zhang, 2010; Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004; Stauss, 2000; Schlosser, 2011). Hedegaard & Simonsen (2013) argued that User Reviews contain a significant amount of usability and UX data. Although their findings imply the existence of UX data within the User Reviews, they haven\u2019t explored how it can be used as a design resource. On the other hand, Van Kuijk et al. (2007) indicates that after sales feedback offers a large potential for gaining insight into real-world product usage and usability issues. And he argues to use those data for ergonomics design. As User Reviews are, in essence, a type of after sales feedback, the combination of the aforementioned researches suggests a way to view User Reviews as a viable source of information in the design process. In this paper, we investigate the practical use of User Reviews in a design process and propose a new technique: User Review Analysis (URA). We focus on how designers can use User Reviews for the design of the next iteration of a product within a certain category (e.g., a new handbag), and how information distilled from User Reviews can complement other user research methods. Although any bid data repository of User Reviews can be used, Amazon was selected, and products of a few categories were analyzed. Workshops with design experts are used to study the influence of User Reviews in the design process. Finally, the value of the User Reviews as a user-generated data and the insights from the workshops are presented and discussed. IASDR2015 Interplay | 2-5 November | Brisbane, Australia !2 User Review Analysis Study We analyzed User Reviews to extract \u2018Experience of product-in-use\u2019 to confirm that they contain valuable information to inform a design process. We selected four product categories: bags, bicycles, shoes and curtains and all having both aesthetic and functional considerations. We show our method with the bag, other products are summarized in Figure 3. Seven office bags (Figure 1) were selected on Amazon.com. For the bags, we sampled 2485 reviews were on May 6, 2014, from 16:00 to 18:00 by using the filtering function of \u2018the most helpful reviews.\u2019 Each review was split into sentences manually and written down on different cards.

{"paperId": "c26e19d26599f8a2423ea06e2a9e7819700c11eb", "title": "Multimodal Interface Design for Ultrasound Machines", "abstract": "Sonographers, radiologists and surgeons use ultrasound machines on a daily basis to acquire images for interventional procedures, scanning and diagnosis. The current interaction with ultrasound machines relies completely on physical keys and touch-screen input. In addition to not having a sterile interface for interventional procedures and operations, using the ultrasound machine requires a physical nearby presence of the clinician to use the keys on the machine, which restricts the clinician's free movement and natural postures to apply the probe on the patient and often forces uncomfortable ergonomics for prolonged periods of time. According to surveys being continuously conducted on the incidence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) for the past decade, up to 90% of sonographers experience WRMSDs across North America during routine ultrasonography. Repetitive motions and prolonged static postures are among the risk factors of WRMSDs, which both can be significantly reduced by introducing an improved interface for ultrasound machines that does not completely rely on direct physical interaction. Furthermore, the majority of physicians who perform ultrasound-guided interventions hold the probe with one hand while inserting a needle with the other, which makes ultrasound machine parameters adjustment unreachable without external assistance. Similarly, surgeons' hands are typically occupied with sterile surgical tools and are unable to control ultrasound machine parameters independently. The need for an assistant is suboptimal as it sometimes difficult for the operator or surgeon to communicate a specific intent during a procedure. Introducing a multimodal interface for ultrasound machine parameters that improves the current interface and is capable of hands-free interaction can bring an unprecedented benefit to all types of clinicians who use ultrasound machines, as it will contribute in reducing strain-related injuries and cognitive load experienced by sonographers, radiologists and surgeons and introduce a more effective, natural and efficient interface. Due to the need for sterile, improved and efficient interaction and the availability of low-cost hardware, multimodal interaction with medical imaging tools is an active research area. There have been numerous studies that explored speech, vision, touch and gesture recognition to interact with both pre-operative and interventional image parameters during interventional procedures or during surgical operations. However, research that target multimodal interaction with ultrasound machines has not been sufficiently explored and is mostly limited to augmenting one interaction modality at a time, such as the existing commercial software and patents on enabling ultrasound machines with speech recognition. Given the wide range of settings and menu navigation required for ultrasound image acquisition, there is potential improvement in the interaction by expanding the existing physical interface with hands-free interaction methods such as voice, gesture, and eye-gaze recognition. Namely, it will simplify the image settings menu navigation required to complete a scanning task by the system's ability to recognize the user's context through the additional interaction modalities. In addition, the user will not be restricted by a physical interface and will be able to interact with the ultrasound machines completely hands-free using the added interaction modalities, as explained earlier in the case of sterile environments in interventional procedures. Field studies and interviews with sonographers and radiologists have been conducted to explore the potential areas of improvement of current ultrasound systems. Typical ultrasound machines used by sonographers for routine ultrasonography tend to have an extensive physical interface with keys and switches all co-located in the same area as the keyboard for all possible ultrasonography contexts. Although the keys are distributed based on their typical frequency of use in common ultrasonography exams, sonographers tend to glance at the keys repeatedly during a routine ultrasound session, which takes away from their uninterrupted focus on the image. Although it varies based on the type of the ultrasound exam, typically an ultrasound exam takes an average of 30 minutes, requiring a capture of multiple images. For time-sensitive tasks, such as imaging anatomical structures in constant motion, the coordination between the image, keys selection, menu navigation and probe positioning can be both time-consuming and distracting. Interviewed sonographers also reported their discomfort with repeated awkward postures and their preference for a hands-free interface in cases where they have to position the ultrasound probe at a faraway distance from where the ultrasound physical control keys are located, as in the case with immobile patients or patients with high BMI. Currently, there exist available commercial software that addresses the repeated physical keystrokes issue and the need for a hands-free interface. Some machines provide a context-aware solution in a form of customizable software to automate steps in ultrasound exams, which reported to have significantly decreased keystrokes by 60% and exam time by 54%. Other machines provide voice-enabled interaction with ultrasound machines to reduce uncomfortable postures by sonographers trying to position the probe and reach for the physical keys on the machine. Interviewed sonographers frequently used the context-aware automated interaction software system with ultrasound machines during their ultrasound exams, which shows a potential for the context-aware feature that multimodal interaction systems can offer. On the other hand, sonographers did not prefer using voice commands as a primary interaction modality with ultrasound machines in addition to the existing physical controls, as an ultrasound exam involves a lot of communication with the patient and relying on voice input might cause misinterpretations of sonographer-patient conversations to be commands directed to the machine instead. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a need for voice-enabled systems augmented with other interaction modalities to be efficiently used when needed and not be confused with external voice interaction. This study aims to explore interfaces for controlling ultrasound machine settings during routine ultrasonography and interventional procedures through multi-modal input. The main goal is to design an efficient timesaving and cost-effective system that minimizes the amount of repetitive physical interaction with the ultrasound machine in addition to providing a hand-free mode to reduce WRMSDs and allow direct interaction with the machine in sterile conditions. Achieving that will be done through additional field studies and prototyping followed by user studies to assess the developed system.", "year": 2016}

However, users often have difficulties in precisely manipulating objects in the 3D space; this is mainly because the user is not provided with enough visual information to sufficiently recognize the spatial relationships among objects. We present a new method for improving the preciseness of object manipulation in the 3D space by providing the user with an auxiliary view that is consistently retargeted to closely highlight the spatial relationship between the manipulated object and the object nearest to it. Both the target and the position of the auxiliary camera are computed efficiently using the bisector surface of the two involved objects. The viewing target is set to the center of the closest area between the two objects, and the camera position is optimized under an objective function primarily measuring the visual clarity of the auxiliary view. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method through various experiments based on practical usage scenarios.", "year": 2019}

This flow of information is analyzed and translated into citizen and commercial services. The city will act on this information flow to make its wider ecosystem more resource-efficient and sustainable. The information exchange is based on a smart governance operating framework designed to make cities sustainable. The public administration needs updated and reliable geospatial data which depicts the urban environment. These data can be obtained through smart devices (smartphones, e.g.), human agents (collaborative mapping) and remote sensing technologies, such as UAV (Unnamed Aerial Vehicles). According to some authors, there are four dimensions in a Smart City. The first dimension concerns the application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to create a cyber, digital, wired, informational or knowledge-based city; the second is the use of information technology to transform life and work; the third is to embed ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in the city infrastructure; the fourth is to bring ICT and people together to enhance innovation, learning, and knowledge. Analyzing these dimensions, it is possible to say that in all of them the geospatial information is crucial, otherwise, none of them are possible. Considering these aspects, this research intends to use the Smart City concept as a methodological approach using the UFPR (Federal University of Parana) as a target to develop a case study. The UFPR has 26 campus in different cities of the Paran\u00e1 State, south of Brazil. Its structure has 14 institutes. It comprises 11 million square meters of area, 500,000 square meters of constructed area and 316 buildings. There are more than 6,300 employees (staff and administration), 50,000 undergraduate students and 10,000 graduate students. Besides these figures, there are external people who need access to the UFPR facilities, such as deliveries, service providers and the community in general. The lack of knowledge about the space and its characteristics has a direct impact on issues such as resources management (human and material), campi infrastructure (outside and inside of the buildings), security and other activities which can be supported using an updated geospatial database. In 2014, the UFPR CampusMap project was started with the indoor mapping as the main goal. However, the base map of the campus was needed in order to support the indoor mapping, the available one was produced in 2000. Thereafter, the campus Centro Polit\u00e9cnico (located in the city of Curitiba) is being used as a case study to develop methodologies to create a geospatial database which will allows to different users the knowledge and management of the space. According to Gruen (2013), a Smart City must have spatial intelligence. Moreover, it is necessary the establishment of a database, in particular, a geospatial database. The knowledge of the space where the events happen is a key element in this context. This author also states that to achieve this objective are necessary the following items: \u2022 Automatic or semi-automated Digital Surface Models (DSM) generation from satellite, aerial and terrestrial images and/or LiDAR data; \u2022 Further development of the semi-automated techniques onto a higher level of automation; \u2022 Integrated automated and semi-automated processing of LiDAR point clouds and images, both from aerial and terrestrial platforms; \u2022 Streamlining the processing pipeline for UAV image data projects; \u2022 Set-up of GIS with 3D/4D capabilities; \u2022 Change detection and databases updating; Abstracts of the International Cartographic Association, 1, 2019. \u00a9 Authors 2019.

This leads to 4D city models; \u2022 LBS (Location Based Services) system investigations (PDAs, mobiles); and \u2022 Establishment of a powerful visualization and interaction platform. Some of these aspects are being addressed in this research. The first one is the integration of indoor/outdoor data to helps the space management and provides a tool for navigation between the spaces. The base map was updated through a stereo mapping compilation from images collected using a UAV Phantom 4 from DJI (https://www.dji.com/phantom4). The use of this technology for data acquisition is not only faster but also cheaper compared to the traditional photogrammetric method. Besides the quality of the images (in this case a GSD \u2013 Ground Sample Distance \u2013 of 2,5 cm), it can be use in urban areas as a rapid response in emergency situations. To georreferencing the image block, it was used 50 control points collected by GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and the software Agisoft Photoscan (http://www.agisoft.com/) to perform the bundle block adjustment with self-calibration. After the processing, the exterior orientation parameters of image block and the tridimensional coordinates of each tie point were calculated simultaneously with the determination of the interior orientation parameters: focal length (f), principal point coordinates (x0, y0), radial symmetric (k1, k2, k3) and decentering distortion coefficients (p1, p2). In the mapping production step, the features were extracted through stereo mapping compilation accordingly the standards defined by the Brazilian Mapping Agency. The several layers were edited in GIS software (QGIS) and then the topology was built. Afterward, it was created a spatial database using Postgre/PostGIS. Also, the dense point cloud was generated using SfM (Structure from Motion) algorithms to allow to generate the digital surface model and orthomosaics. Meanwhile, a website using HTML5+CSS3\uf0e2 and JavaScript\uf0e2 technologies was developed to publish the results and the first applications. (www.campusmap.ufpr.br). The architecture of this application uses JavaScript\u00ae, LeafLet, PgRouting library (to calculate the routes between interest points), files in GeoJson format and custom applications. The indoor database comprises the data about the interior of the buildings and provides to the user some functionalities such as: search for rooms, laboratories, and buildings; routes between points (inside and outside the buildings), floor change. Also, some web applications were developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the use of geospatial information in an environment very similar to a city and its problems, e.g. parking management, security, logistics, resources inventory, among others. It was developed a mobile application to provide the indoor user positioning through Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) networks. This, combined with the indoor mapping, will allow the users to navigate in real time inside the buildings. Using the data from the point cloud and the CityGML standard it was developed a 3D model of some buildings. An application to inform crime occurrences (such as robbery, assaults) was also developed so these occurrences can be mapped, and the administration can increase the security of the campus. The next steps are: a) Design an interface with functionalities to integrate all applications which are being presented in individual Webpages; b) Develop a visualization tool for 3D models using CityGML; c) Evaluate the potential of UAV images for different applications in urban scenarios; d) Develop an interface for collaborative database update. e) Expand the database to other campus of UFPR and develop new functionalities to different users; The \u201csmart city\u201d concept allows to develop an optimized system that use geospatial data to understand the complexity of the urban environments. The use of the geospatial data can improve efficiency and security to manage urban aspects like infrastructure, building and public spaces, natural environment, urban services, health and education. Also, this concept can give a support to the city management agents during the design, realization and evaluation of the urban projects. In the present project, we believe these are the first steps to build a connected environment and apply the \u201csmart city\u201d concept into the university administration to make the sustainable use of resources and could suit as an example to some existing problems in public administrations.

Results of a cross-sectional survey with 453 Amazon customers show that users of CGR express significantly higher trusting beliefs and perceived decision quality than users of SGR, while users of SGR elicit higher perceived enjoyment and lower perceived decision effort than users of CGR, resulting in different effect mechanisms toward OPR continuous usage and purchase intentions. Additionally, results also showed that product type (search & experience) significantly moderate the effects of OPR use on consumers\u2019 OPR evaluation beliefs, indicating the way different type of recommendation sources (SGR vs CGR) for different types of product are comprehended and assessed.

This paper discusses the necessity of intelligent furniture. Intelligent furniture is a kind of modern multi-functional furniture, is one of the development trend of modern multi-functional furniture, but also from the development of intelligent building to intelligent home, the ineviTable requirement to realize intelligent home. This paper classifies intelligent furniture products, summarizes the ways and methods of intelligent furniture, and summarizes the basic principles of intelligent furniture product design. On the basis of studying the concept of product family, this paper defines the concept of intelligent furniture product family and constructs the intelligent furniture product family from the perspective of functional analysis, which serves for modular design and mass customization production and lays a foundation for the realization of intelligent furniture system. 1. Development of modern multi-functional furniture 1.1 Characteristics and styles of modern furniture Modern furniture reflects modern people's lifestyle, modern technology, materials and economic characteristics, adapt to modern people's physiological and psychological conditions, adapt to modern people's living habits, indoor environment, etc., meet modern people's aesthetic needs. Modern furniture is a broad, changing concept that develops continuously as The Times. Modern furniture has the following characteristics: (1) Universality of furniture use Since ancient times, furniture has been widely used. All activities of people are related to furniture, such as desk and office chair for work, desk and chair for study, Table and dining chair for people to communicate with others, sofa and bed for rest. With the development of history, the progress of science and technology, and the changes of people's life style, the development of furniture has not been stagnant. [1] New types of furniture, such as children's furniture, SOFO office furniture, multi-functional furniture, etc., are constantly emerging, meeting the needs of different user groups with different functional characteristics. (2) Duality of furniture functions The dualism of furniture function is to point to material and artistic two respects, the use function of corresponding product and mental function. Furniture is a kind of material existence above all, it is a kind of product, it is the indispensable appliance in people's life. Usually products will pursue spiritual pleasure after meeting the use needs, and art is to meet people's spiritual needs. In today's extremely rich material to design furniture as art creation, can design a popular furniture works. (3) Sociality of furniture From the history of furniture development, it can be seen that the development of society promotes the development of furniture, and in turn, furniture can reflect the development of society, which is the sociality of furniture. The design style of furniture reflects the cultural characteristics 2019 3rd International Conference on Artificial intelligence, Systems, and Computing Technology (AISCT 2019) Copyright \u00a9 (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/aisct.2019.057 281 of The Times, the production level of furniture reflects the development level of social productivity, and the use and purchase amount of furniture reflects the social lifestyle. Modernism, as a design trend and concept, as a design school, refers to the \u201cmodernism\u201d that emphasizes rationalism and functionalism in the design history from the early 20th century to the mid-1960s. Modernism fundamentally changed the traditional design and formed the design style of modernism. Modernism opened the door of modern design, the modern style of furniture also begins popularity subsequently. 1.2 Characteristics and development direction of modern multi-functional furniture Multifunctional furniture is a kind of furniture form that realizes other reasonable new functions on the basis of the basic functions of the furniture itself, which is a redesign of the furniture. Multi-functional furniture can be divided into two categories: monomer multi-functional furniture with \u201cone thing and multiple functions\u201d and multi-functional combination furniture with \u201cmultiple things and super functions\u201d. (1) Monomer multi-functional furniture Monomer multi-functional furniture is a kind of modern furniture products which have the basic functions of traditional furniture and are similar to traditional furniture in shape. [2] Be like malfunction sofa, the function that it increased deck chair on the foundation of common sofa can sit, can lie, the change of two kinds of configuration needs to press the black button of side only can realize, this kind of product has been opposite on market general, some still can swing before and after like rocking chair. (2) Multi-functional combination furniture Multi-functional combination furniture is a kind of modern furniture product with different spatial forms, which forms new functions through some functional monomers and changes in the combination of using functions or shapes. At present, people's communication mostly relies on the network to achieve by mobile phone or computer, and a variety of chat tools also make communication more convenient. A large number of mobile phone control, micro blog control, network has become a material existence that modern people cannot do without. Product designer of Jerusalem Naom FASS design electronic seat system in order to meet the demand of modern people to the network real-time, set up in every component of a module of USB interface to connect to the Internet, can be easily connected with laptops, Tablets and phones, also can achieve a variety of combination way, according to the requirements of individual users can be very comfortable to lay, recumbent, sitting posture on the Internet. Modern multi-functional furniture has the following features: (1) Space saving Multi-functional furniture sets a variety of functions in one, with a small space area, easy to achieve functional conversion, so that the space has flexibility, there is a strong practicality, especially for small and medium-sized family to release more space is conducive to improve the flexibility of space utilization. [3] (2) Novel style Most of the multi-functional furniture modeling is simple, novel and unique, in line with the modern young consumer groups seeking new and different, emphasis on self, emphasis on individual aesthetic needs. (3) Easy to use When the function of multifunction furniture is designed, the rationality that considered functional collocation, harmonious sex, satisfy the convenient sex that people USES. The convenience of use is also reflected in the convenience of moving, convenient to change the form, change as needed, the change of form does not need too much effort, general ladies can easily assemble and use. Modern multi-functional furniture towards two directions: one is the direction of exquisite, the miniaturization, to meet the high house prices under pressure to the needs of the growing number of", "year": 2019}

To realize these aspirations requires systematic and well-defined (re)search into human conditions, materiality, and the spatiality of architecture. This is achieved through innovative and rigorous inquiry based on repetitive results, the ability to validate them, and the transferability of the knowledge. While scholarly work describes and explains the nature of a process or a phenomenon, applied research also allows for the prediction of future outcomes\u2014a projective explanation facilitating new discoveries. This predictability is directly tied to achieving repetitive results and advancing the broader design knowledge beyond a singular creative instance. Architectural research also needs to be directed and intentional. When mathematics found itself with a number of unresolved problems over a century ago, German mathematician David Hilbert proposed a collection of twenty-three problems that set the course for mathematical research in the twentieth century. Similar vision and leadership are necessary in our field today. Architecture has to develop a broad, socially supported, timely vision to direct our future efforts. The 2030 carbon-neutral commitment is an important part of this vision.1 However, it should be translated into discrete research objectives jointly supported and advanced by practitioners and academics. New knowledge needs to be developed and shared. The research-in-practice perspective offered by AIA past President, and current UIA President, Thomas Vonier advocates for research to take a more prominent role in professional practice. This research, he argues, should build on the unknown and fill expertise gaps while staying \u201cfocused on measurable results, demonstrable outcomes, and tangible benefits.\u201d2 The current discussion of sustainability, resiliency, and carbon/water net zero buildings expands to include research into human factors and the ways people operate within the built environment. Designing for a statistically average person is no longer adequate or appropriate. Considering each and every person individually is necessary as is already accomplished in other media, design, and engineering disciplines. Mass-customization of products and services is being extended into the built environment with buildings anticipating and adapting to user needs. Internet of Things technologies combined with computer-human interactions provide new ways to interface with architecture and study occupancy patterns and behaviors. However, to be effective and protect the public welfare, we have to better understand scientific methodologies and frameworks that ensure that user-based research is conducted scientifically and ethically. Institutional review boards (IRB) provide such guidelines, as discussed in \u201cArchitectural Research Legally and Ethically Considered\u201d by Lynne M. Dearborn and AnnaMarie Bliss. The tenuous and often indirect relationships between art/design and research are evident in the creative works of Theo Jansen. His sketches and studio setup reveal an in-depth engagement with scientific reasoning and technology. The \u201cartificial life\u201d forms are informed by highly analytical studies of nature with thoughtful and imaginative syntheses. Jansen\u2019s work provides a good example of design supported and directed by research. The proof of concept manifests itself through fully accomplished and functional designs that are appreciated by the broad public and that advance our understanding of kinetic designs. The knowledge embedded in developments of analog sensors and actuators is transferable into other disciplines, however it awaits meaningful architectural responses and applications. Another of Hilbert\u2019s achievements is the formulation of the concept of metamathematics\u2014a mathematical reflection on the study of mathematics using mathematical methods. This disciplinary self-reflection differentiates between reasoning from inside and from outside of a system. It acknowledges that certain problems can only be understood and solved with an outside-of-the-system perspective. Interdisciplinary team research, evident in this issue of TAD, provides opportunities for both inside-out and outside-in reflection on architecture. Not only do these contributions reveal underresearched and unresolved problems but also define new disciplinary goals and challenges.", "year": 2018}

More specifically, we study the effects of using an online platform to motivate and track employee driven activities. We use a unique dataset of close to 500 employee driven activities responding to the overall strategic goals of a large pharmaceutical retail chain in Sweden.It goes without saying that expertise, experience, ideas, creativity and skills among employees are valuable resources in the company\u2019s innovation work (Hoyrup, 2010) and support achievement of competitive advantages (Kesting & Parm Ulhoi, 2010). EDI include acting on your own ideas and not only respond to needs of the organization (Loven, 2013), furthermore EDI includes both bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down perspectives on innovation (Hoyrup, Bonnafous\u2010Boucher, Hasse, Lotz, & Moller, 2012). The presence of EDI is dependent on mechanisms that influence the organisation\u2019s innovation capabilities (Kesting & Parm Ulhoi, 2010). Dominant mechanisms include fundamental determinants of work engagement known from motivational research, such as the need for autonomy, competence and relatedness (Hakanen & Roodt, 2010; Mauno, Kinnunen, & Ruokolainen, 2007) but also feedback and the possibility of seeing one\u2019s own part in the bigger picture (Hackman & Oldham, 1980).Amundsen et al. (2014) who suggest that important factors for stimulating EDI include leader support through the generation, registration, evaluation and realisation of ideas; a collaborative climate including interactions between colleagues and between employees and external contacts; rendering autonomy and delegation of decision\u2010making authority to employees. Research has also highlighted several restraining forces for EDI, such as the gap between management and employees and the fact that managers are not capable of seeing the things that employees meet in their daily work (Kesting & Parm Ulhoi, 2010).Despite the vast knowledge relating to motivational theory, social comparison and social facilitation surprisingly few studies examine how this knowledge could be combined and successfully be put to practice to promote EDI. The focus on the majority of work has been on investigating restraining and enabling factors of EDI (Aaltonen & Hytti, 2014; Kesting & Parm Ulhoi, 2010), exploring how EDI occurs in teams (Kristiansen & Bloch\u2010Poulsen, 2010) and small organizations (Aaltonen & Hytti, 2014). As a result of this, we know a lot about what need to be accomplished to promote EDI, but we do not know what tools work or not to reach those accomplishments. In particular, we know little about how this could take place in large organizations where people are spread geographically.By drawing upon knowledge from social cognitive theory (Bandura, 2001) showing that strong perceived collective efficacy increase people\u2019s aspirations and motivations, we analyze the outcomes from a year-long strategic work at a large pharmaceutical retail chain in Sweden. This takes shape in a database consisting of detailed information on close to 500 employee-driven activities in a large pharmaceutical retail chain in Sweden. Social cognitive theory extends the conception of human agency to collective agency (Bandura 1997) where people\u2019s shared belief in their collective power is a key ingredientMethodWe use a unique data set of close to 500 employee-driven activities entered in a cloud-based, online database. The database was used as a means to active the employees at the 370 retail units in an organizational change project launched earlier the same year. The project started off with 32 physical dialogue meetings between the CEO and the retail unit staff where the overall strategic goals were presented and discussed. Ambassadors in management positions were appointed at each retail unit, responsible to encourage, initiate and document the activities rendered by the employees. The online database allowed for constant transparency between the retail units \u2013 giving the possibility to share ones ideas and experiences, mistakes and successes throughout the whole year while the project was running. The database consist of secondary data, as we did not intervene in the creation or execution of the project. Same thing goes for the written evaluation made after the project was completed \u2013 where employees were asked about their impressions and experiences from using the database. The retailing business is highly competitive and the geographical spread of employees makes it a suitable context to explore the use of online tools of this kind for promoting EDI in other large businesses or smaller businesses geographically spread. We used mainly qualitative analysis methods to explore the database as well as simple quantitative analysis to produce frequencies and descriptive data. By coding each activity according to the degree of innovativeness and type of activity (e.g. internal process, customer service) we could form a good understanding of the outcomes from using the database.Results and implicationsOur study of the database and the subsequent employee evaluation form reveals interesting and uplifting results. For example, 64 % said the online tool helped them better understand the overall strategy and 85 % were happy with the user interface and continuous work with the tool. Also, half of the retail outlets claimed the tool helped them run projects which increased sales considerably. Among the more successful activities were one initiating earlier opening hours (which previously was attempted to be pushed up-down without success) \u2013 this activity alone corresponded to the average turnover of 22 outlets. The result are in line with social comparison and social facilitation theory, showing how public praise and social comparison seem to improve employee driven innovation motivation (Mumm and Mutlu (2001). Although comparative studies are hard to find (we did not) similar findings were made in the use of mobile exercise applications. A recent study by Hamari and Koivisto, 2015) shows that social influence, positive recognition and reciprocity have a positive impact on how much people are willing to exercise. In fact, the more \u201cfriends\u201d a user the larger the effects were, which could explain the success of the online tool in this study \u2013 which involved the exposure among more than 300 outlets. Our findings, similar to Hamari and Koivisto (2015), further our understanding on the phenomenon of social influence showing, how public recognition and network effects contribute to the collective employee-driven innovation.", "year": 2016}

Using a cross-project approach, this paper examines the prevalence, effectiveness and inclusiveness of 84 SLEETs deployed in 72 local energy projects in the UK from 2008 to 2018. An original framework for the characterisation of SLEETs was employed, which grouped them into seven types and characterised them in terms of their level of interaction and interface design. Our study shows that information-driven tools were the most popular in community energy groups, while digital energy platforms or interaction tools with numeric interfaces were the most popular in smart local energy system (SLES) initiatives. In contrast, interaction tools with visual interfaces, and tools offering control were found to be less popular. Spatial analysis revealed that SLEETs were mostly deployed in areas with grid constraints (technology), active community energy groups (people) and engaged local authorities (policy). Effective SLEETs were found to stimulate engagement amongst people (social engagement), and between people and technology (operation and control), while inclusive SLEETs enabled the inclusion of vulnerable and low-income households. The acceptance and implementation of SLES initiatives can be enhanced by creating effective and inclusive SLEETs that align with local users\u2019 requirements and are supported by local stakeholders in order to foster trust.

REDIRECT is a masterpiece.\" -Malcolm Gladwell What if there were a magic pill that could make you happier, turn you into a better parent, solve a number of your teenager's behavior problems, reduce racial prejudice, and close the achievement gap in education? There is no such pill, but story editing the scientifically based approach described in REDIRECT can accomplish all of this. The world-renowned psychologist Timothy Wilson shows us how to redirect the stories we tell about ourselves and the world around us, with subtle prompts, in ways that lead to lasting change. Fascinating, groundbreaking, and practical, REDIRECT demonstrates the remarkable power small changes can have on the ways we see ourselves and our environment, and how we can use this in our everyday lives.It is one important in-store shelf displayed factor to influence the traditional fast-moving consumer individual purchase decision making behavioral change in any supermarkets or stores when they feel hurry to do personal time pressure consumption decision to make purchase final decision in the point to point counter purchase ( the brand's of products are moved from the traditional shelf location visual attention moves to the strange shelf location visual attention) in supermarket time pressure consumption environment.Hence, in supermarket time pressure consumption environment, in -store and out-of-sore both factors can influence fast-moving consumer individual purchase decision making. The in-store factors can influence product packaging, product placement components as well as the out-store factors can influence choice task, preference and brand recognition components. So, it is common to influence supermarket consumers choose do personal time pressure purchase consumption decision of visual attention purchase behaviors. The different brands' products are displayed to different shelf locations in order to cause shelf displaying products' different decision making effect.However, instead of shelf displaying location factor, package will also influence consumers' decision making, due to the influence of minute differences in packaging design on visual attention. When, the supermarket consumer feels the brands are not familiar or unfamiliar. Then, he/she will spend more time to evaluate and verify the unfamiliar brands' products whether which one is value to buy in her/his decision making process. He/she will feel visual attention need in order to evaluate in set of brand alternatives to make conscious demand mind cognitive effort by involving working memory. So, if the product's package is attractive, even the consumer is unfamiliar the brand's any product choices which are displayed on the shelf location in the supermarket. The brand's attractive package factor can influence the consumer to raise whom visual attention. Then, the attractive package factor can increase much visual attention chance to many consumers when they are walking to pass through the unfamiliar brand's any products' shelf displaying location considerably. So, it explains when attractive package factor may solve the visual attention problem to fast-moving consumers when they are visiting one strange supermarket to find anywhere unfamiliar brand's products' shelf displaying locations. Because they are the non-traditional consumers to the unfamiliar brand's products, they won't be influenced to choose either buying or not buying the unfamiliar brand's products. When the unfamiliar brand's products are moved to another new shelf displayed location. So, if the unfamiliar brand has attractive package to let the non-traditional consumers feel visual attention when they are passing through the strange shelf displayed location. Then, it can raise purchase chance to the non-traditional consumers target number when they are staying in the strange supermarket.Research Paper (postgraduate) from the year 2012 in the subject Business economics Operations Research, grade: B, The University of Liverpool, language: English, abstract: This paper investigates the influence of e-commerce and related factors on the consumer behaviour with respect to the purchase decisions of mobile phones. The different factors that influence the consumer behaviour related to buying mobile phones have been identified in this research. Electronic commerce or e-Commerce consists of the buying and selling of products and services over electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks. The amount of trade conducted electronically is remarkably increased with the widespread use of the Internet (Blackwell, 2006). To facilitate global trade various schemes for transaction of electronic money have been introduced. Such schemes offer concrete solutions to the risk associated with trust, information security, international finance, and other factors posing uncertainty. Trust is a major focus of e-commerce professionals. In traditional trade much of mechanisms for building trust are related to the form of communication between the participants and costs related to the contact in person. In case of remote access (in terms of the Internet, for example) many of the traditional mechanisms for establishing trust between participants exists. Therefore, options to enhance or introduce other new mechanisms are used for confidence building (Bodenhausen, 2012). There are different forms of e-commerce. The e-commerce models are:Decision Neuroscience addresses fundamental questions about how the brain makes perceptual, value-based, and more complex decisions in non-social and social contexts.

New challenges are accompanying its spread into other clinical fields. With awareness of the importance of PAC systems among various medical experts, this system has been enhanced through the PAC system's pipeline, and simplification of image display for analysis via an interaction with the user. Generally PAC system consists of medical image, patients' data acquisition, storage, and display subsystems integrated by digital networks and application software. PAC system facilitates the systematic utilization of medical imaging for patient care. However, even though PAC system consist of medical image, data acquisition, storage and display subsystems, most of available PAC system does not have image analysis as required by the clinical expert. If the PAC system do have this element, it need interaction or interference from the clinical expert as user, and the PAC system storage mostly is an unstructured storage with no analysis element and report modules. And unfortunately in most cases, for the web-based PAC system, there are delayed in retrieval and visualize the required image from outside of the hospital. Most of the PACS with function of 3D display, it did not communicate information clearly and efficiently to users (clinical expert). Most of the visualization did not visual accurate information as required by the clinical expert. These listed constraints limited the clinical expert perspective regarding his/her decision. From market validation observation we concluded that most of the PAC system available in market does not have medical image processing functions for the purposes of decision analysis with minimum user interaction. Research towards this limitation has been conducted in accordance with the needs of clinical experts. Among these studies are: (i) angiography image processing for stenosis position detection and measurement of its dimensions, (ii) echocardiography image processing for detection of ventricular cardiac abnormalities (walls and volume) and (iii) 2D angiography images reconstructed to 3D images for display purposes and to identify the location of artery tree. With the result of these studies, the PAC system will integrate with extra modules, which are: i) 3D reconstruction function from single image angiogram with identification of the stenosis location, ii) Identification of abnormality heart wall chamber, iii) 3D reconstruction echocardiography left and right ventricular heart, and iv) 3D fused within CTA, angiography and MRI. As stated above, the common limitation for the web-based PAC system is the delayed in retrieval and visualize the required image from outside of the hospital/clinics. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a technique and integrated a related function for faster transmission of the processed image without sacrifice any importance information. And to complete the PAC system so that the new PAC system able to compete with current PAC system that available in market, we link the PACS with our Patients Clinical Record Database with report modules as required by the medical expert. The outputs of all those said researches will be integrated with the PAC system where each research output has been tested and validate by numbers of cardiac expert, the patients clinical record database has been tested in UKMMC and the PAC system currently being beta tested in a Private Clinic in Kelang, Selangor, Malaysia. Eventually the PAC system with the Patients Clinical Record Database will be integrated with these image analysis and 3D image visualization and it is plan to be tested in Veterinary Hospital of Universiti Putra Malaysia. To forward this project to commercialization activity, we have distributed questioners to Clinics in area Bangi (Selangor, Malaysia) and Nilai (Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia). There are 58 Medical, Veterinary and Dental Clinics received the questioner (currently we expand the distribution towards Serdang and Kajang (Selangor, Malaysia). Out of 58 clinics; a) 16% interested to collaborate and looking forward to see PAC system, b)8% interested with the PAC system but do not willing to have any demo, c) 44% not interested but open for demo of system, d) 28% not interested and not willing to have demo system and e) 4% return the form without answered for that particular question. To secure and protect the ownership, each research output has been submitted for Patent filed in Malaysia and with three chosen country, where 2 of the patent filed has been granted in Malaysia. We also copyrighted each module. This project has been selected by Universiti Putra Malaysia to be commercialized by a startup company seeded by UPM (CASD Medical Private Limited) under program INNOHUB. We realize to implement the complete PAC system in Hospital there are 10 main problems exist that we might need to overcome or try to minimize the consequences. These problems are; i) Integration with the Hospital Information System. Although a lack of inter-vendor device and IT integration can often make the problem worse, the market is improving as providers and meaningful use demand greater integration. Unfortunately, still, many radiologists and PACS administrators prefer to make full use of hospital IT to configure their own systems and achieve a bit more autonomy, ii) Every system has downtime where we need to establish alternate workflows. Both scheduled and unscheduled, but they need not have to be too serious to minimize the effect on patient care, iii) Non-standardized hanging protocol display is a common and pesky challenge for PACS users. Images from different modalities are not organized by default even though each of them generally will be transmitted through DICOM format getaway, each study takes a little longer to read. As the number of scanners increases and the sample of vendors expands, the problem grows worse, iv) Integration problems concern hardware, from digitizing pre-DICOM modalities to integrating systems for advanced image reconstruction. Add-ons like a DICOM converter can help squeeze out additional value from older CT, angiography and fluoroscopy systems, v) As with downtime, failures are unavoidable, there is a need to demonstrate strong support activities, vi) Effective training can be a cost-effective way to demonstrate to administrators and physicians many of PACS' underused and undervalued features. Training wil help to expose staff to what the system can do to make their jobs easier and more efficient, vii) The migration of data to the new PACS is often the most challenging part of the process, both in negotiating the release of data from the current PACS and in sorting out all the data entry errors that have accumulated over the lifespan of the system, viii) As other specialties realize the value of PACS, the system is slowly being taken out of radiologists' hands. PACS has become a mission-critical enterprise-wide tool used by nearly all specialties. With this change, decision-making for PACS-related purchases, upgrades and configurations has, in some cases, shifted from radiologists to a more central process, ix) Hiring a certified public ergonomist to evaluate the department's workstations can ease radiologists' repetitive stress symptoms and contribute substantially to productivity. Despite accelerating advances in technology, many interface tools have changed little since the introduction of PACS, and finally x) Like business continuity, disaster recovery can prevent a painful experience from becoming fatal. Many hospitals opt for either redundant servers, cloud storage or both. At the very least, preparation for downtime can spare physicians and patients from experiencing significant losses. To minimize the consequences of the listed 10 main problems, this project (in early stage) targeting potential customers among the owner of the small private clinics where the numbers of patients is less and the bureaucracy of the administration is limited.", "year": 2016}

Effective participation of stakeholders in interactive work sessions requires fast and accurate modeling systems with a user-friendly interface, which can simulate the impact due to various flood reduction measures selected by the stakeholders and also generate outputs that can be understood by all stakeholders, especially those who are not FRM specialists. Presenting an easy-to-understand tool with easy inputs and outputs for a variety of stakeholders and at the same time providing reliable and accurate results for a range of scenarios and interventions is a challenge. Seven requirements that are essential for a user-friendly flood risk tool were used to develop an instant flood risk modeling tool. This paper presents a web-based hydraulic tool, i.e., instant flood risk model (Inform), to support FRM in the urban center of Can Tho city (Ninh Kieu district), Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Inform was developed based on (i) a simplified 1D model for the entire Mekong Delta; and (ii) flood hazard and damage maps, and estimated flood damage for Ninh Kieu district in Can Tho city obtained directly from the 1D/2D coupled model for Ninh Kieu district. Inform rapidly generates flood levels, flood hazard and damage maps, estimated damages. Pilot testing with experts confirmed that Inform qualifies as a reliable co-design tool for developing FRM strategies as it features an inbuilt input library, comprises flexible options, easy to use, produces quick results and has a user-friendly interface. With the help of an interactive web-based tool such as Inform presented here, it is possible to co-design FRM strategies for Can Tho or any other city that is subject to flood risk.", "year": 2021}

Most of it has focused on the technologies but not the users\u2019 spatial controllability. To assess this, we analyze a users\u2019 common operational area through partitioning, including a layered array of one dimension and a spatial region array of two dimensions. In addition, to determine the difference in spatial controllability between a sighted person and a visually impaired person, we designed two experiments: target selection under a visual and under a non-visual scenario. Furthermore, we explored two factors: the size and the position of the target. Results showed the following: the 5 \u00d7 5 target blocks, which were 60.8 mm \u00d7 48 mm, could be easily controlled by both the sighted and the visually impaired person; the sighted person could easily select the bottom-right area; however, for the visually impaired person, the easiest selected area was the upper right.

Such holographic elements may for example improve orientation, navigation, and the mental representations of space generated through interaction with the environment. As AR hardware is still in an early development stage, scientific investigations of the effects of holographic elements on spatial knowledge and perception are fundamental for the development of user-oriented AR applications. However, accurate and replicable positioning of holograms in real world space, a highly relevant precondition for standardized scientific experiments on spatial cognition, is still an issue to be resolved. In this paper, we specify technical causes for this limitation. Subsequently, we describe the development of a Unity-based AR interface capable of adding, selecting, placing and removing holograms. The capability to quickly reposition holograms compensates for the lack of hologram stability and enables the implementation of AR-based geospatial experiments and applications.

The authors hypothesize that effective human computer interface design has a positive impact on security perception. To test this hypothesis, they use the seven design elements of the customer interface (7Cs) as a basis of the reference framework for effective interface design. Hypothesis testing was examined through an empirical study involving 247 subjects. Research reveals that human computer interface design significantly affects the perceived security of e-commerce portals. Further analysis of the results highlights that the top HCI factors that influence security perception are permanent working links, demos and online help tools, information accuracy, and easy website navigation. Therefore, this study suggests that applying good user interface design guidelines at the storefront can be an effective technique for enhancing user security perception and increasing trust and purchase intention.

Further, a Gartner study (Gartner, 2006) reported that US retailers lost near $2 Billion in e-commerce sales because of the security fears of online shoppers. In particular, about half of the $2 Billion losses were due to consumers who avoided sites that they perceived to be less secure, while the remaining losses were attributed to people who, in the first place, were afraid to engage in e-commerce transactions. For most retailers, however, the agony is that the main deriver of consumers\u2019 reluctance to buy online mostly comes from their perception of e-commerce security, rather than from the real lack of security per se. As a result, customers\u2019 positive perception of security is an essential pre-requisite to their willingness to engage in online transactions with a site (Turner, 2003; Zhao-Fu et al., 2010; Fogg et al., 2001). Here we adopt Salisbury (2001) definition of security perception as \u201cthe extent to which one believes that the web is secure for transmitting sensitive information\u201d (p. 166). Understanding the nature of end users\u2019 perception of security and the factors that influence this perception has been the subject of extensive research during the past few years. Most of the earlier contributions have focused on the impact of website security and privacy features on users\u2019 security perception and trust (see e.g., Xiaoyan & Zhiying, 2010; Ally & Toleman, 2005; Yousafzai et al., 2005; Chellappa & Pavlou, 2002). Online trust is a multi-faceted and contextdependent construct that involves cognitive, behavioral, psychological, cultural, uncertainty and risk factors, among others. Perceived trust can be built and reshaped before, during and after the online transaction (Wang, 2009). The concept can perhaps be better understood by invoking Egger\u2019s (2000) Model of Trust for Electronic Commerce (MoTEC). MoTEC recognizes three main trustInformational content inducing factors (aka filters) that can potentially convert users into e-commerce customers. These are pre-purchase knowledge, interface properties, and information content. Pre-purchase knowledge captures those external factors that can influence consumer\u2019s initial trust before any online interaction takes place. Among these factors, are the vendor\u2019s brand name and reputation, user\u2019s previous online or offline experience with the vendor, user\u2019s disposition of trust, and input from trusted third parties (including word-of-mouth, media reports). In particular, Radke et al. (2010) conducted a qualitative research that showed that the brand reputation of the company whose website users thought they are browsing is a key perceived intangible security feature. This finding was also confirmed by the earlier empirical work of Turner et al. (2001) and Halaweh and Fidler (2008). Bhattacherjee\u2019s (2005) model of trust recognizes that familiarity (knowledge of the trustee based on prior interactions or experiences) can lead to willingness to transact either directly or via the mediation of trust. Interface properties shape two constructs, namely familiarity and attitude. Familiarity refers to the system\u2019s usability (ease-of-use), including learnability, consistency, flexibility and reliability. Ease-of-use is generally perceived as a strong indicator that the company cares for its customers. When first-time visitors access a site for the first time, ease of use, smooth website navigation and pleasurable online experience can potentially affect how much they feel in control of the site (Araujo & Araujo, 2003). To this effect, Church and Whitten (2009) argued that the purpose of computer security is about giving people control over computers and information and this shares one of the goals of Human Computer Interaction. Singh (2002) argued that guided navigation reduces perceived risk for customers originating from high uncertainty avoidance cultures. Attitude reflects the appeal and first impression the system makes on its users in terms of the visual appearance created by graphic and visual designs, as well as other superficial cues about navigation and reliability of the e-commerce application (Egger, 2001).

The solid wood panel industry, marked by substantial raw materials and energy consumption, stands at the forefront of addressing this challenge. This research delves into production scheduling and equipment utilization inefficiencies, offering innovative solutions for the solid wood panel processing line aimed at achieving environmental sustainability and operational efficiency. The study is articulated through two main segments: (1) an exhaustive analysis and the development of a simulation system for the solid wood panel processing line, delineating all production elements and operational logic, furnished with a user-friendly simulation interface, and (2) a comprehensive evaluation and enhancement of various scheduling algorithms specific to the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) encountered in solid wood panel workshops. A significant leap forward is made with the introduction of the Adaptive Intelligent Optimization Genetic Algorithm (AIOGA), an evolved version of the standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) engineered for optimal scheduling within the solid wood panel processing line. AIOGA incorporates advanced features such as encoding strategy, population initialization, objective function setting, selection strategy, crossover operation, and mutation operation, demonstrating the methodological depth of the study.

This tool has proven popular, with thousands of downloads and nearly 200 literature references. Flopy is designed as a preand postprocessor for MODFLOW models that interacts with native MODFLOW file formats. The development of Flopy was motivated by principles of repeatability, extensibility, and flexibility in an open-source framework. When combined with geographic information systems (GIS), Flopy can serve a similar purpose as a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable visual inspection of model structure, properties, and results. As an open-source project, 50 contributors have committed to the development of the software, led by a core design team who also approve or deny proposed changes. This allows any user to customize Flopy for their needs and, if their additions are found to be generally useful and robust, they are incorporated into the main tool. Flopy is developed in the Python scripting language, which makes it possible to document all model construction and data processing steps for a modeling project. Aspirationally, this enables reproducibility where another modeler could pickup, understand, repeat, and build from the scripts a modeler creates. Practically, this is a high bar and scripts developed to use Flopy for MODFLOW models may be challenging to fully repeat. However, having a scripted record of modelrelated processing increases the likelihood that important decisions and challenges that could result in errors (e.g., unit conversion or geolocation) are discovered more efficiently than if there was no record of the process.", "year": 2022}

Also with the rate of crime across cities in the UK like mass shootings, murder and gang gun battles, the UK Police system within localities are overwhelmed or may not efficiently cope with crime alerts and incidences coming in at increasing frequencies. However looking in the area of real time crowd reporting, there is need to leverage technology to enhance public safety, improve incident response, and foster community engagement. This necessitated the aim of this study to develop a digital policing surveillance app for crowd reporting in the UK. By utilizing digital policing surveillance apps, the aim is to improve crowd management capabilities by enabling real-time reporting of incidents and observations from both the public and law enforcement personnel. This was positioned to facilitate better situational awareness, efficient resource allocation, and effective response strategies.

A clean designed frontend design system with Bootstrap version 5\u2014an open-source, reusable design framework created by Twitter\u2014was selected for its easy user interface. The system was put through 50 concurrent load tests with actual users swarming the app since the DP app was subjected to hundreds of people complaining in real time. 2. The host computer had a Core i5 vPro CPU running at 4GHz and 4GB of RAM. The result shows that 50 users successfully generated an average of 29.7 requests per second. The system scaled up nicely to 50 users and reached its highest response time of 2600 milliseconds (2.6 seconds) in total. A dramatic rise in activity and a longer response time occurred after there were more than 50 users. The system could not operate at its peak efficiency with 100 users because response times were inconsistent and exceeded 7000 milliseconds (7 seconds) for each request.

Part of the reason may lie in inefficient strategies for disseminating research and product development to end users: aging adults living in communities. CONTENT Our symposium will discuss strategies adopted by university-specific and federally-funded USA Centers to disseminate research findings both to the scientific community and to aging populations. It will highlight: 1) methodologies in common across centers; 2) different challenges for locally funded and nationally funded centers; and 3) evaluation processes to assess dissemination plans and strategies. STRUCTURE Czaja discusses the evolution of the CREATE center, a five-times funded (National Institutes of Health) interdisciplinary group with over 20 years of experience in human-factors-guided development of gerontechnology. Boot discusses the dissemination plan in a new Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center, ENHANCE, funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), that provides formal training about product development and marketing to principal investigators. Sanford discusses a mature NIDILRR center, TechSAge, and provides examples of how TechSAge disseminates its findings. Charness discusses the mission of the Institute for Successful Longevity, a relatively young university-based Center, and how it provided community support during the initial lockdown stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, Rogers discusses a relatively new University center, CHART, and the role of partnerships in developing community linkages. CONCLUSION Bridging the gulf between academic research and product development requires linking academic research, product developers, and community members to ensure that gerontechnologies suit diverse aging populations. We provide specific examples of how both academic and federally funded research centers can develop effective dissemination strategies to ensure that both developers and aging adults partner effectively in the development and dissemination of gerontechnology products. Such partnerships are crucial for bridging the digital technology divide. Purpose The Center for Research and Education on Aging and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) was founded in 1999 and is a multi-disciplinary, multi-site Center that is supported by the National Institutes of Health. The focus of CREATE is on aging adults and their interactions with technology systems. The overarching goal of CREATE is to harness the potential benefits and power of technology to maintain, support, and foster the cognitive, emotional, and physical health of aging adults to enhance independence, well-being, and quality of life. Method The aims of CREATE are to conduct research aimed at developing, implementing, and evaluating technology-based solutions that support successful and productive aging; provide interdisciplinary training and research opportunities to students and junior scientists; and broadly disseminate the findings, protocols, and tools of CREATE. To achieve these aims CREATE has a research program that includes individual and cross-site projects (Weill Cornell Medicine; Florida State University, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) and a pilot research program; Administrative, Data and Technical Development, and Dissemination Cores and Community, Scientific and Industry Advisory Boards. The conceptual framework for CREATE is based on a transactional model of person-technology interactions which recognizes the importance of individual differences, the influence of context (physical and social) on performance, and that human-technology interactions are dynamic and changes over time. CREATE\u2019s research approach is guided by a combined Human Factors Engineering and Cognitive Psychology approach with a focus on user-centered design. The user-centered design process is a fundamental component of our research projects. Our cross-site structure enables us to examine issues surrounding aging and technology with diverse populations in diverse contexts. It also enables us to expand our scientific and technical resources and to broaden our dissemination footprint. Results and Discussion CREATE has developed a comprehensive data base on aging and technology; examined issues of aging and technology across a range of tasks, technologies, and populations; promoted new areas of research; trained new investigators; and broadly disseminated our findings and tools nationally and internationally to researchers, policy makers, service providers, and aging adults. Our research portfolio encompasses attitudinal issues, issues related to technology adoption and acceptance, input and interface design, training and instructional support, and technology applications in living, work, leisure, and healthcare settings. The research projects explore innovative uses of existing technologies and support the development of new technology tools and are designed to make contributions to science and yield practical outcomes with direct impacts for older adults and families. Importantly, our book Designing for Older Adults (part of the Human Factors and Aging Series) , jointly authored by the CREATE Principal Investigators, is now in its third edition and we also co-authored a compendium Case Studies companion book. CREATE also has established strong community and industry partnerships, that are essential to our research, training, and dissemination programs. Overall, CREATE strives to develop, implement, and evaluate technology-based lines of research, interventions, and programs, to support health and wellbeing; ensure that technology applications achieve full potential, and are accessible, useful to, and usable by diverse populations of aging. Purpose The ENHANCE Center represents a consortium of three institutions (Weill Cornell Medicine, Florida State University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The focus of ENHANCE is on developing novel technology solutions to help older adults living with cognitive impairments live independently. The target populations of the ENHANCE Center are older adults living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), older adults living with cognitive impairments due to traumatic brain injury (TBI), and older adults living with cognitive impairments due to stroke (PSCI). Technology solutions developed by ENHANCE aim to support transportation and mobility needs, socialization and cognitive engagement, and prospective memory functioning. Method The ENHANCE team of investigators and key members includes experts in human factors engineering, gerontology, neurology, rehabilitation medicine, psychology, applied health sciences, communication disorders, biostatistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. A multidisciplinary perspective is crucial to the development of useful and usable gerontechnology for older adults living with cognitive impairments. Gerontechnology design involves an iterative, user-centered design process, including feedback from older adults, care partners, and community and industry stakeholders at all stages of development. Multiple large and small-scale needs assessment studies provide valuable information regarding challenges older adults with cognitive impairments face in their everyday lives and potential technology-based solutions. In addition to traditional academic dissemination routes (e.g., conferences, journal publications), a diverse External Advisory Board facilitates bidirectional communication among researchers and community and industry partners to ensure relevant needs are being addressed and findings reach outside of the laboratory/academic setting. Evolving technology transfer plans aim to maximize the chances for developed technologies to have real world impact. Finally, webinars are another method of dissemination, including to technology designers, and student design competitions help to engage and train the next generation of gerontechnologists. Results and Discussion The work of the ENHANCE Center aims to improve the lives and community engagement of older adults with cognitive impairments and the developed infrastructure of the Center aims to ensure that findings reach those for whom they would be most useful. Purpose The Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center Technologies to Support Aging-in-Place for People with Long-term Disabilities (RERC TechSAge) is a multi-disciplinary, multi-site Center founded in 2013 that is supported by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research, which is housed in the Administration for Community Living, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. TechSAge features multidisciplinary research, development, and training projects that are dedicated to understanding the needs of, and developing supportive technologies for, people aging with long-term vision, hearing, and mobility disabilities. Method TechSAge aims to support and empower people with chronic conditions and long-term impairments to age-in-place through increasing knowledge about, availability of, and access to effective design and technologies that enable individuals to sustain independence; maintain health; engage safely in basic activities at home and in the community, and fully participate in society. To achieve these aims TechSAge has an administrative core as well as research, development and training programs at Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, and Georgia State University that are guided by an Advisory Board with academic, scientific and industry advisors. The conceptual framework is based on the TechSAge Aging and Disability Model which integrates the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health and ecological models of person-environment fit, to recogn", "year": 2022}

Built-in sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and ambient lighting sensors) and external sensors have increased the variety of possibilities for interactions between users and those devices, such as touch-based and gestural interaction. Mobile and wearable devices are creating new ways of conducting business and changing how people communicate, interact, and entertain. Despite the increasing popularity of mobile applications, usability, accessibility, and interaction remain as significant challenges. This special issue focuses on examining issues and techniques related to human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) in mobile computing, hereafter referred to as mobile HCI. We received more than 30 submissions to the special issue. After two rounds of rigorous review process, seven articles were accepted for publication in this special issue. These articles present significant, cutting-edge research findings and best practices in the field, and build a bridge from current and emerging research to the future. The first article entitled \u201cThe Effects of Visualization and Synchronization on Clustered-based Mobile Web Search\u201d by Ashwag Alasmari and Lina Zhou examines the effect of the presentation of search engine results on the limited screen size of mobile devices on search efficiency, search effectiveness, and navigation efficiency in the context of close-ended (search target is one item) and open-ended (search target is multiple items) tasks. Drawing on cognitive load theory and information foraging theory, the authors hypothesize that the effect of synchronous versus asynchronous presentation of search engine results and list-based versus radial-based presentation of clusters of search engine results is moderated by the type of search tasks (i.e., close-ended versus open-ended). The findings of their experimental study suggest that radial visualization enhances search and navigation efficiency, particularly for open-ended tasks, whereas synchronous presentation improves navigation efficiency. The second article, \u201cTripartite Effects: Exploring Users\u2019 Mental Model of Mobile Gestures under the Influence of Operation, Handheld Posture, and Interaction Space\u201d by Kening Zhu, Xiaojuan Ma, Haoyuan Chen, and Miaoyin Liang, examines the effect of three types of text-related operations (caret positioning, input configuration, and text editing), three types of handheld postures (one-hand holding with onethumb operating, one-hand holding with one-index-finger operating, and two-hand holding with two-thumbs operating), and three interaction spaces (on-screen, mid-air, and combined) on users\u2019 mental models through user-defined mobile gestures. The results of their experimental study indicate that each of the three factors has an effect on users\u2019 mental models. The findings suggest that users assign different meanings to on-screen versus mid-air gestures, and the types of user-defined gestures in mid-air are more functionality oriented than those that are on-screen. Different gestures are also likely to be assigned to different fingers such that both thumbs can access the \u201chard-to-reach\u201d area of the device screen or specify an area on the device screen. It is easier to evoke mental images using text editing operations than caret movements or input configurations, and caret movements have higher conceptual complexity than text editing and input configurations. The third article entitled \u201cAdapting the Navigation Interface of Smart Watches to User Movements\u201d by Fan Mo, Jia Zhou, and Shuping Yi used a within-subjects experimental study to assess the effect of user movement (sitting, walking, and running) and navigation aids (no aids, static aids, and animated aids) on task effectiveness, task efficiency, perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived cognitive workload, and flow experience. The results suggest that the use of smart watches while running has a negative effect on task effectiveness (i.e., success rate of operations), perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived cognitive overload, and flow experience. There is a moderating effect of user movement and type of navigation aids on perceived cognitive overload and perceived ease of use and usefulness, such that static navigation aids are more suitable for sitting and walking, whereas animated navigation aids are more appropriate for running.", "year": 2017}

Electronic questionnaires were developed to collect data. Data collected from 392 questionnaires was analyzed by means of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Findings indicated that CBE has a significant positive impact on brand satisfaction, trust, and loyalty respectively via the online brand experience. This study contributes to knowledge development by focusing on the importance of CBE and its consequences in the online service sector, which is still uncovered.

It has become essential to the organizations to provide brand value and superior services in the hope of engaging their customers more (Potdar et al., 2018). The customer\u2019s role in the interaction with the brand is at the center of the engagement concept (Patterson et al., 2006). Engagement with the brand is vital for the long-lasting brand-customer relationship, particularly for service brands (Chang and Fan, 2017; Potdar et al., 2018; Algharabat et al., 2020). CBE is an emotional state that includes a customer\u2019s passion and desire for the brand (Brodie et al., 2011). This concept depends on the significance of participating customers in cooperative and co-creative experiences (Bijmolt et al., 2010; Brodie et al., 2011). Thus, CBE can provide both unique and memorable brand experiences, which will help in developing brand trust, satisfying customers, and promoting brand loyalty (Brodie et al., 2013; Hollebeek et al., 2016; Hollebeek et al., 2018; Iglesias et al., 2019). Currently, the advancement of the internet and the shift toward digital transformation have contributed to the progress of CBE and brand experience (Wirtz et al., 2010; Algharabat et al., 2020). Keeping an effective engagement with the user via frequent online interactions remains a vital issue for developing a unique and creative brand experience (Iglesias et al., 2019). Despite the importance of this topic, previous studies such as Mollen and Wilson (2010); Hollebeek et al. (2014); Dessart et al. (2015); Dwivedi (2015); Zhang et al. (2017) and Iglesias et al. (2019) mentioned the need to provide a clear understanding of CBE and its consequences in a specific sector. Thus, this paper focuses specifically on the banking sector in Egypt due to its great importance and its vital role in the economy. Egypt has the biggest banking sector in North Africa (Oxford, 2019). The banking sector in Egypt is one of the oldest and largest in the region. It is one of the key pillars of the Egyptian economy. Since, it plays a crucial role in the development process in Egypt (El Essawi and Abd El Aziz, 2012). Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 14 Issue 3 July 2020 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Centre for Business & Economic Research (CBER) 23 Egyptian banks keep evolving and adapting new technologies because today, customers are more influential. Customers can switch from one bank to another if they were not satisfied with the service. In Egypt, 75% of banks offer internet banking services. And investing in technology is the future for the banking sector (Brussels Research Groups, 2019). Consequently, the severe competition and technological advancement have led the Egyptian banks to change their focus from service-oriented services to customer-oriented ones, which highlighted the need to focus more on CBE in the online banking context. Besides, the previous studies were conducted in the European context and did not take into consideration the CBE, the online brand experience, and its consequences, namely brand satisfaction, loyalty, and trust in a single study. The purpose of this paper is to provide a better interpretation and to fill the gaps found in the previous studies by focusing on the role of CBE on building brand satisfaction, loyalty, and trust via the online brand experience in one research model in the Egyptian banking sector. This study is organized as follows: First, the literature review of CBE, online brand experience, and their consequences. Second, the research methodology. Third, the results and analyses. Fourth, the discussion of the results followed by theoretical and practical implications. sixth, the conclusion and finally limitations and future directions are presented. Literature review Customer Brand Engagement Customer engagement is a recurring interaction that takes place between a customer and an organization; this interaction reinforces the emotional, physical and or psychological relation the customer has with the organization (Phang et al., 2013; Hollebeek et al., 2014). Based on the above, customer engagement has been linked to improving corporate performance (Jaakkola and Alexander, 2014), gaining better competitive positions (Kumar and Pansari, 2016; Gong, 2018), creating new markets (Storbacka et al., 2016) and, boosting satisfaction of the customer and increasing loyalty and trust in the brand (So et al., 2014). Customer engagement is also linked to brand performance indicators such as sales development, customer participation and customer feedback (Sawhney et al., 2005; Bowden, 2009; Kumar et al., 2010; Van Doorn et al., 2010) other factors can also be attributed to engagement among them are cost reductions, superior profitability, brand recommendations and improved co-creative experiences (Bijmolt et al., 2010). It has been proven that a customer engagement with a brand is not just the process of interaction between the customers and brands rather it is a fundamental tool in developing deeper customer-brand relationships. (Van Doorn et al., 2010; Hollebeek, 2011; Pratomo and Magetsari, 2018). Co-creation is what happens when the customer shows impulsive, unrestricted and flexible behaviors that exclusively customize the customer brand experience (Lusch and Vargo, 2006; Sprott et al., 2009). To develop customer engagement with a brand, it is also crucial for the brand organization to make marketing efforts (Ong et al., 2018; Prentice et al., 2019). Particularly in the service sector, as service companies provide intangible products that are hard for customers to realize before purchase. Consequently, studies recommend engaging customers in actions other than exchange, boosting a wider and more positive brand experience (Solem and Perderson, 2016). Currently, due to the internet companies can easily establish an ongoing dialogue with customers and develop an online experience toward the brand (Sawhney et al., 2005). Most of the earlier studies viewed the brand experience as a consequence of CBE (Vivek, 2009; Ramaswamy and Gouillart, 2010; Brodie et al., 2011; Hollebeek, 2011; Hollebeek et al., 2014). Therefore, the company needs to enhance CBE to create a unique online brand experience (Pratomo and Magetsari, 2018). In the online banking sector, Nysveen and Pedersen (2014) suggested that building unique and favorable brand experiences and co-creation involvement should help to engage customers with the brand. Thus, a bank can create a positive and constructive online banking experience by improving the CBE of the bank\u2019s brand (France et al., 2016). Thus, based on the above arguments, the researchers assume that CBE impacts online brand experience and thus propose the following hypothesis: H1. CBE has a significant positive direct impact on customer\u2019s online brand experience. Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 14 Issue 3 July 2020 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Centre for Business & Economic Research (CBER) 24 Online Brand Experience Brand experience can be described as the view of the customers, at every contact they perform with the brand, it can be through advertising, during the first face to face interaction, or shown in the level of quality and personal care they receive (Alloza, 2008). Brand experience is shown in the customer\u2019s spontaneous feelings of the brand (Kabadayi and Alan, 2012). Studies suggest that from the customer\u2019s point of view brand experience is essential for a holistic evaluation of the brand (Nysveen et al., 2013, Khan and Rahman, 2015). When a brand can deliver unique and favorable brand experiences, it can distinguish itself apart from competitors and attain its objectives (Brakus et al., 2009). The brand experience differs in its power and can be either positive or negative, with extensive influence on customer behavior (Brakus et al., 2009). Rapid action and timed reply to negative commentaries as well kind attitude to customer complaints generate sincere effect on the customer\u2019s mind. This helps companies achieve promising insights of their brand and enriches their customer understanding. The company can attempt to more impact customers by offering a superior experience, consequently generating customer confidence, which will lead to customer loyalty (Potdar et al., 2018). Brand experience doesn\u2019t stop at products and services in the marketplace; it is also originated from the online searching of products or services (Brakus et al., 2009). The development of communication technologies has resulted in online brands that bring online brand experiences to customers (Ha a", "year": 2020}

It is the era of creative economy soaring, and vigorously developing cultural and creative industries is the general trend. China's game industry has now become a very important part of the creative culture industry in China. With the rapid development of the times, the development and design of games in China has higher standards than before. This is a new proposition for colleges and universities that cultivate talents. Chengdu is the new first line of China's National Center City, and it is the major town of China's game research and development and production. In Sichuan, the training of game art talents in colleges and universities is based on the demands of the game R &amp; D and production enterprises in Chengdu. By analyzing the problems in the process, it is learned that it is necessary to focus on the \"reserve and training mode of game art talents in Sichuan universities\", hoping to propose some suggestions for this in the new era. 1. The overall situation of the game industry in China \"2017 China game industry report\" summed up the overall market revenue in 2017 was 203 billion 610 million China game industry; China game users has reached 583 million people; by the end of 2017, the number of Chinese listed gaming enterprises reached 185, of which A shares listed gaming company 151, accounting for 81.6%; the Hong Kong stock market game company 26, accounting for 14.1% of the United States; the game shares listed 8 companies, accounting for 4.3%; approved by the State Administration of press and publication published about 9800 game models, the domestic game about 9310, about 490 of imported games, the domestic game accounted for absolute proportion in Chinese game industry output value; overseas market, Chinese self-developed online games overseas market actual sales revenue reached 8 billion 280 million dollars, an increase of 14.5%; as an important cultural and creative products, China self-developed game is going to have on the world more and more The influence. 2. The scale and situation of the game enterprises in Sichuan The game companies in Sichuan are mainly concentrated in Chengdu. According to statistics, at present, there are about 390 games related businesses in Chengdu, but the gaming industry in Chengdu has experienced explosive growth, and the game team has reached more than 1000. From the beginning of 2015, the Chengdu gaming industry began to shuffle, entering a more rational and mature stage of development, mainly reflected in two aspects: on the one hand the resources to focus on a small number of high-quality enterprises further; on the other hand, the National Games of the \"king of glory\" in the birth of Chengdu, also hit a booster for the Chengdu gaming industry\". Now the industry concentration is still at a high level, and 16 enterprises with revenues of over 100 million contribute nearly 85% of business revenue in Chengdu game area. Under the rule of survival of the fittest, many teams that cannot find investment and lack core competitiveness can only face the outcome of elimination.

The importance of game art design and the present situation of talent Game industry chain is composed of four aspects: game R &amp; D, game distribution, distribution channel and operation support. Game art is an essential and very important part of the game research and development. Art design excellence is needed to keep a good games, games can enhance the brand image, enhance the aesthetic interest and the game player, the game will make the products with the development of the recognition, can enhance the competitiveness of the market operation and promotion, but also facilitate the game peripherals products strong. The rapid development of the game industry has prompted the quality of game products to continue to improve and improve. The requirements of the game art become more severe. At present, the whole game industry is short of the demand for \"high talent\". Most of the talents trained in Colleges and universities have a certain or greater distance from the requirements of the post, so it is often vicious competition in the industry to \"dig for talents\". 4. A survey of the reserve of game art talents in Colleges and universities in Sichuan There are 109 colleges and universities in Sichuan (including higher vocational and technical colleges), according to incomplete statistics, of which nearly 40 colleges and universities have art and design majors. Nearly 40 colleges and universities of art and design in Sichuan, about 20 colleges and universities set up animation professional, new media art or CG related courses, and there are not many schools that have game design major. According to incomplete statistics, the number of all the above major in the school is about 5000, and the number of graduates is more than 1000 per year. Some of the graduates focus on animation, some focus on new media art technology applications, some focus on CG illustration and picture books. Few of them will focus on Game Art Design of \"full process teaching\". The reasons will be discussed later. 5. Research on the training mode of Sichuan College Game Art Talents 5.1 Existing problems 5.1.1 Low entrance threshold and thin fine arts In 2017, the number of people who passed the art college entrance examination in Sichuan province was 27945, of which nearly 70% of them were not satisfied with their cultural achievements. They took the shortcut approach, and after several months' cram style art examination intensified training, they hurried onto the \"Mei Ke\" road. Professional passing is not very difficult. In addition, with the \"parallel volunteer\" way to volunteer, especially in private universities, the competition for students is fierce, so the threshold of last university is not high. But most of the students are thin in fine arts. 5.1.2 Colleges and universities are blindly running school and the teachers are thin With the development of the times and the needs of the industry, some colleges and universities do not have the game art design major or curriculum under the premise of increasing the enrollment gimmick to enhance the competitiveness of the students, but also open the specialty blindly for improving economic efficiency. In order to quickly set up a professional, usually from other related professional personnel engaged in teaching and post haste to the teachers, because of the lack of understanding of the industry, but the lack of project experience and practical experience, therefore in the teaching of students in the industry tend to ignore the aesthetic aspect and creative thinking, also deviated from the industry specification.", "year": 2018}

Unlike traditional media, such as TV, radio or newspapers, social media is characterized by freely available user-generated content. In addition to gaining phenomenal popularity as the web becomes accessible via all sorts of devices, they also have a strong influence on brands, making social media a force that many businesses can no longer ignore. However, among these network applications and services, it has been reported that some public relations companies hired people to post product comments on different online communities and social networks, without even consuming the services or products. While online paid posters can be used as an efficient e-marketing strategy, they can also act maliciously by spreading gossip or negative information about competitors. More specifically, a group of paid posters could operate with well-coordinated attacks and generate a desired result of positive or negative opinions, to attract attention or trigger curiosity. This kind of suspicious online behavior is known as \u2018crowdturfing\u2019 or \u2018astroturfing\u2019, which may mislead the public perception and bring a negative effect on both the Internet users and society. Technically, crowdturfing is closely related with other known suspicious online behaviors: spam email, fake review, social spam and link farming. Therefore, how to exploit the characteristics and behavior patterns of crowdturfing from the massive user information and user-generated content has become a challenging task. The research field is very extensive, and as a result, recent years have witnessed increasing research attentions on curbing crowdturfing in social networks like contentbased method, behavior-based methods, social relation-based methods and applications and open case study. This trend raised the need for launching this special issue, and we solicit the recent theoretical and application output in curbing crowdturfing. Based on the invited extension of the best work in the International Conference on Applications and Techniques in Information Security and an open call, four submissions have been accepted to best illustrate the recent directions and perspectives. The papers in this issue report a variety of methods in securing cyberspace and curbing crowdturfing and mainly involve the following aspects: the security algorithm optimization, the encryption scheme, abnormal behavior discovering and ciphertext update. These work proposed more security and efficiency schemes in various kinds of crowdturfing detection, traffic classification and monitoring systems, meanwhile against selective identity adaptively chosen-message attacks. Here, we provide an integrative perspective of this special issue, by summarizing each contribution contained therein. In [1], Tang et al. proposed an optimization algorithm to improve the efficiency in traffic classification system, network monitoring system and network intrusion detection system (NIDS). More specifically, they introduced a character escaping and replacing scheme to decrease the size of DFA\u2019s character set and to reduce DFA\u2019s space requirement through optimization. Then based on transition rewriting, a space-efficient and time-efficient DFA presentation, Reduced Input Character Set DFA (RICS-DFA), is proposed together with an efficient constructing algorithm. For real rule sets, ICS-DFA reduces the memory consumption by 68\u201392%, compared with the original DFA, and this paper designed a scalable RICS-DFA matching engine on FPGA platform on which the reduced state transition matrix is mapped to on-chip memories. The throughput of executing deep packet inspection for real world rule sets can achieve 7\u201350.5 Gbps. In [2], Yan et al. proposed a pre-image sample algorithm with outputs obeying irregular Gaussian distribution and then designed the construction of hierarchical identity-based signature. Two measures were adopted to prevent the leakage of the geometrical property of trapdoor caused by irregular Gaussian outputs.

Although the Apple iPad was originally envisioned as a single user device, school districts and universities across the country are purchasing tablets and other mobile devices in massive quantities for innovative use in classrooms (Lawrence, 2012; Price, Jewitt, & Crescenzi, 2015; Tate, 2012). There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence (i.e., success stories) on the effectiveness of mobile devices in the classroom (Clarke & Abbott, 2013; Lenovo Education, 2012b; Mahaley, 2013; Morelock, 2011) and best practices for getting started (Victoria Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, 2011; Lenovo Education, 2012a; Mahaley, 2013); and in the last few years there are more researchers examining the effectiveness of mobile devices on student achievement (Chou, Block, & Jesness, 2012; Kucirkova, Messer, Sheehy, & Fernandez Panadero, 2014; Ross, Morrison, & Lowther, 2010). The prevailing scholarly literature on mobile learning reflects positive correlations between student engagement and effective use of technology (Chen, Lambert, & Guidry, 2010; Falloon & Khoo, 2014; Laird & Kuh, 2005), perceived engagement and perceived learning while using iPads (Diemer, Fernandez, & Streepey, 2012), and comfort levels and prolonged use of the iPad (Diemer et al., 2012). While many of these studies were conducted in higher education institutions, there continues to be the need to focus on research in K-12 schools, especially in the early childhood education setting. Many of the previous studies have focused on user-friendly interface, mobility, touchscreen, and connectivity to a world of resources and apps (Price et al., 2015). Falloon (2013) conducted a study in New Zealand with 18 five-year-olds to investigate if using iPads with students could support learning. Falloon (2013) concluded all apps used for instruction should be evaluated for design and content prior to implementation in the classroom. Falloon (2013) also found that the disruption of an innovation and novelty of the devices could be used to motivate students and create engagement for innovative learning opportunities. Finally, Falloon (2013) alluded to the importance of incorporating formative and corrective feedback with students in the learning process. Other researchers have focused on mobile devices to create student collaborative efforts and increase engagement when learning using the iPad. Kucirkova et al. (2014) examined the effects of a story-making app using 41 four- and five-year-old students from Madrid, Spain. Supported by previous research, Kucirkova et al. (2014) found that specific app features and content could influence the degree to which children's engagement in the learning task was of \"educational value\" (p. 176). This research supported the notion that the iPad is a game changer in education and that we need to find more ways to harness it as a powerful teaching and learning tool. Hwang and Chang (2011) conducted a study in Taiwan using formative assessment to determine if students' attitudes and achievement could be affected when using mobile devices. They found that utilizing a mobile learning approach could improve students' attitudes and achievement. Due to the many promising learning opportunities, there continues to be a need for empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these devices on specific areas of student achievement. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine how integrating mobile devices into a Pre-Kindergarten curriculum using informal feedback from students affects Pre-K students' academic achievement (i.e., Print Knowledge, Phonological Awareness, Mathematics, Oral Language/Vocabulary) at a rural, public charter school in the southeast. Mobile devices, which include tablets, smartphones, PDAs, e-readers, and MP3 players, can be used to customize student learning and address education inequality when integrated into the classroom by innovatively informing policy and practice. \u2026", "year": 2017}

INTRODUCTION Web-enabled information systems present a particular challenge to interoperability because they are strongly heterogeneous in terms of their application domains, as well as their modeling languages. We propose to use metamodeling environments for development of web-enabled information systems. Metamodeling is extensively used in information system analysis and design as a powerful mechanism for abstraction. The abstraction enables modelers to describe complex systems, e.g., systems that provide many different user-specific functionalities and complex services (including distribution of resources, concurrency, etc.). Furthermore, the design phase itself is being carried out under stringent requirements, e.g., making software reuse possible, providing formal toolboxes for simulation and validation of models, and automatically generating code from formal specifications. In such a demanding context, abstraction is carried out by two complementary mechanisms: abstraction by conceptualization and abstraction by projection. An overview of such abstraction mechanisms follows. Abstraction by conceptualization strives to structure a given description of an information system into several layers that constitute a metamodeling architecture. Many modeling environments refer to OMG\u0092s metamodeling architecture, depicted in Figure 4, which goes beyond the two-layer description of databases by proposing four layers: instance, model, metamodel and meta-metamodel layers. \u0095 The metamodel layer describes\u0097at an abstract level\u0097an application domain. More precisely, the metamodel layer defines which modeling constructs are to be used for modeling of information systems belonging to a given application domain. For example, the profiles of OMG are standard extensions of the UML metamodel that are dedicated to specific application domains. In Selic and Rumbaugh (1998), the authors propose three main constructs\u0097capsule, port and connector\u0097for their extension of UML to real-time modeling. They explain the need for a new construct port: \u0093Although ports are boundary objects that act as interfaces, they do not map directly to UML interfaces. A UML interface is purely a behavioral thing\u0097it has no implementation structure. A port, on the other hand, includes both structure and behavior.\u0094 \u0095 The meta-metamodel layer describes how the real world is seen. A metametamodel encompasses a high-level description of the underlying logics (e.g., boolean or modal logics), a particular time model or spatial model which will be used to capture the semantics of the real world.

(Conception UX pour la suppl\u00e9ance de la m\u00e9moire afin de soutenir les t\u00e2ches de r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes dans les applications analytiques)", "abstract": "This thesis was initiated in the context of enhancing the user experience for analyzing data due to the increase of the volume of data related to this activity. On the one hand, users\u2019 psychological needs for the simple use of analytic applications are paid more attention than before; on the other hand, the task they are willing to conduct is getting more and more complicated, which may cause memory overload that influences the task performance. To ensure that both aspects are taken into account, the designers should provide a proper information and design a proper interface that meets both users\u2019 needs and the requirements of their activity. In this research, we are interested in improving the task recommitment following a task suspension or interruption in the context of a visual data analysis task. The multitasking nature of user actions and limited storage capacity of human working memory cause difficulties in re-engaging an interrupted or suspended task. Therefore, it is beneficial to have a memory supplementation tool that supports users to recommit their task in optimal conditions. A literature review first leads to the positioning of our research on the enactive approach and sensorimotor perception that consider the tool as an artifact configuring the interaction between the user and the task, in two modes the \u201cput down\u201d mode and the \u201cin hand\u201d mode. From this point of view, we have found that the commonly used cognitive memory model ignores the role of interaction with the external world in the formation of the memory, and consequently ignores the \u201cin hand\u201d dimension of the artifacts in one memory construction. Therefore, we complete this model with the embodied memory, which gives us a new perspective to design an appropriate memory tool that serves as a supplementation of our perceptual system. Finally, the design principles in human-computer interaction and UX helped us build a tool and conduct an experimental plan highlighting the link between changes in perception conditions and changes in the dynamics of interaction. As a conclusion, the research problem is introduced in terms of how we can provide users with a relevant context to recommit to resolving a task after interruption. The design proposal needs to be explored, designed and evaluated. The first experiment, the exploratory study, analyzes the perception of interactive applications by experienced designers. This study helped us construct a vocabulary of evaluation of the design for a memory supplementation support and guided us for the design considering these criteria. In the second experiment, we develop a tool based on a function that we call the \u201chistory path\u201d, which permits to show, in a specific window of the user interface, some of the steps of a previous task resolution that a user has performed during previous experience (or to simulate a resolution task interruption). We set up a simple (minimalist) experiment simulating a problem-solving task, which was recorded to evaluate the extent to which a history path support can help the user for efficient recovering of an interrupted task. The first part of this experiment allows us to confirm the potential use of this function and helps us explore the design space. In the second part, we experiment two different tools, based on two history path representations, a static one and a dynamic one. The evaluation results allow us to understand the technical conditions of a positive experience for which task recovery is facilitated. In this second experiment, several means for recording the user experience were mobilized: the evaluation of the durations and gaze frequencies on area of interest in the interface window by eye tracking, the recording of the verbalizations during the RTA (Retrospective Think Aloud) session, and the semantic evaluation.", "year": 2018}

It generates the strategy that underlies sales techniques, business communication and business developments.It is an integrated process through which companies build strong relationship and create value for their customers and for themselves.Marketing is used to identify the customers, to satisfy customer. With the customers the focus of its activities, it can be concluded that marketing management is one of the major components of business management.The objectives of all business are to makes profits and a merchandising concern can do that by increasing its sales at remunerative prices. This is possible, if the product is widely polished to audience the final consumers, channel members and industrial users and through convincing arguments it is persuaded to buy it. Publicity makes a thing or an idea known to people. It is a general term indicating efforts at mass appealConsumers play a much more active role in searching for information online with some goal in mind, and that goal can influence individual behaviors and responses to online information and advertisements (Smith, 2002). With the rapid advancement in the computer industry, many companies have made the Internet as part of their advertising media mix to take advantage of the online technologies (Calisir, 2003).The growth of internet advertising is both globally and locally outpacing offline advertising. While outdoor advertising is also experiencing growth, it is not growing as rapidly as Internet advertising. 1.1 ADVERTISING Advertising denotes a specific attempt to popularize a specific product or service at a certain cost. It is a method of publicity. It always intentional openly sponsored by the sponsor and involves certain cost and hence is paid for. It is a common form of nonpersonal communication about an organisation and or its products idea service etc. that is transmitted to target audiences through a mass medium. In common parlance the term publicity and advertising are used synonymously. 1.2 What is advertising? The word advertising is derived from the Latin word viz, \"advertero\" \"ad\" meaning towards and \"verto\" meeting towards and \"verto\" meaning. \"I turn literally specific thing\". ISSN: 2249-1058 \uf026Impact Factor: 6.559 64 International Journal of Marketing and Technology http://www.ijmra.us, Email: editorijmie@gmail.com Simply stated advertising is the art \"says green.\" Advertising is a general term for and all forms of publicity, from the cry of the street boy selling newspapers to the most celebrate attention attracts device. The object always is to bring to publicnotice some articles or service, to create a demand to stimulate buying and in general to bring together the man with something to sell and the man who has means or desires to buy\". 1.3 Internet Advertising Internet advertising is a form of promotion that uses the Internet and World Wide Web for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages to attract customers. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads on search engine results pages, banner ads, Rich Media Ads, Social network advertising, online classified advertising, advertising networks and e-mail marketing, including e-mail spam. Online video directories for brands are a good example of interactive advertising. In developing an advertising programme, one must always start by identifying the market needs and buyer motives and must make five major decisions commonly referred as 5M (mission, money message, media and measurement) of advertising. 1.4 Basic Features of Advertising 1. It is a mass non-personal communication. 2. It is a matter of record. 3. It persuades buyers to purchase the goods advertised. 4. It is a mass paid communication. 5. The communication media is diverse such as print (newspapers and magazines) 6. It is also called printed salesmanship because information is spread by means of the written and printed work and pictures so that people may be induced to act upon it. 1.5 Objectives of Study \uf0b7 To study whether current internet advertisement are effective. \uf0b7 To find out the awareness level among consumers towards internet advertising \uf0b7 To determine the relationship between internet advertisement and consumer behaviour ISSN: 2249-1058 \uf026Impact Factor: 6.559 65 International Journal of Marketing and Technology http://www.ijmra.us, Email: editorijmie@gmail.com 2.0 Review of Literature Clinton Amos (2008) Itexplores the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and Advertising effectiveness.This study provides a quantitative summary of the relationship between celebrity endorser source effects and effectiveness in advertising. Korgaonkar and Wolin (2002) itexamined the differences between heavy, medium, and light web users and concluded that \u201cheavier users hold stronger beliefs about and attitudes toward Web advertising which likely lead to stronger purchase intent\u201d.

However, due to the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments, this may not be feasible. Adjunctive internet-based interventions specifically designed for youth may provide a cost-effective and engaging alternative to prevent loss of intervention benefits. However, until now online interventions have relied on human moderators to deliver therapeutic content. More sophisticated models responsive to user data are critical to inform tailored online therapy. Thus, integration of user experience with a sophisticated and cutting-edge technology to deliver content is necessary to redefine online interventions in youth mental health. This paper discusses the development of the moderated online social therapy (MOST) web application, which provides an interactive social media-based platform for recovery in mental health. We provide an overview of the system's main features and discus our current work regarding the incorporation of advanced computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement and improve the discovery and delivery of therapy content. Methods: Our case study is the ongoing Horyzons site (5-year randomized controlled trial for youth recovering from early psychosis), which is powered by MOST. We outline the motivation underlying the project and the web application's foundational features and interface. We discuss system innovations, including the incorporation of pertinent usage patterns as well as identifying certain limitations of the system. This leads to our current motivations and focus on using computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement, and to further improve the system with novel mechanisms for the delivery of therapy content to users. In particular, we cover our usage of natural language analysis and chatbot technologies as strategies to tailor interventions and scale up the system. Conclusions: To date, the innovative MOST system has demonstrated viability in a series of clinical research trials. Given the data-driven opportunities afforded by the software system, observed usage patterns, and the aim to deploy it on a greater scale, an important next step in its evolution is the incorporation of advanced and automated content delivery mechanisms.", "year": 2017}

This paper presents findings of exploratory analysis of the data collected in this test. Clustering of day patterns from FMS data reveals large day-to-day variability of user behavior, which cannot be captured by a snapshot with a one-day survey. Even the high crosssectional variability from the larger sample size of a traditional survey would not have achieved the comprehensive set of heterogeneous patterns as provided by FMS. Some common problems in traditional surveys \u2013 such as under-reporting of trips, over-estimation of travel times, and inaccuracy of locations and times \u2013 can apparently be reduced by FMS. The FMS data, as compared to HITS, have higher resolution and better accuracy. In addition, FMS is well suited to collect multi-day data as additional costs are marginal and user burden reduces over time. FMS offers a promising technology for next generation travel data collection. Zhao, Pereira, Ball, Kim, Han, Zegras, Ben-Akiva 3 INTRODUCTION The unprecedented and increasing penetration rate of smartphones together with advances in mobile sensing technology have greatly expanded the means of collecting various forms of personal transportation data. Traditional self-reported travel surveys typically suffer from problems such as limited sample size, under-reporting of total completed trips, imprecision in reported trip start and end times (1). Smartphone-based surveys present the opportunity to collect more detailed and precise data needed for emerging agent and activity-based behavioral models. Developments in this field (2, 3) suggest that location-enabled technologies can reduce the number of erroneous \u201cno travel\" days and missed trips; improve accuracy of reported trip times, locations and paths; and, reduce respondent burden. The usage of mobile technologies for automatic surveying is not new. GPS-based logging surveys have been widely implemented worldwide and largely successful as a supplement to traditional household travel surveys (4, 5, 6, 7). However, pure GPS logging suffers from some limitations. Financially, the agencies conducting travel surveys must purchase and distribute the GPS collection devices, which can be a significant investment. Also, the participants may forget to carry the GPS loggers with them for the duration of the travel survey, and they may still face a recollection problem when completing their travel diary. In contrast, smartphones provide some clear benefits. For instance, users are accustomed to carrying their phones with them constantly, with adequate battery life, thus decreasing the likelihood of missing trips. Furthermore, smartphones contain a combination of sensors \u2013 such as Bluetooth, WiFi, accelerometers, and GPS \u2013 which expand upon pure positioning data, providing a richness which can be used to infer activity and mode information. These attributes make smartphones ideal \u201clife-loggers.\u201d The Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) system capitalizes on these \u201clife-logging\u201d capabilities in a next-generation travel survey system, leveraging increasingly pervasive smartphones, advanced sensing and communication technologies and a machine learning architecture (8). With a web-based prompted recall user interface, FMS delivers a previously unobtainable range of data, more closely reflecting what people do, not what they say they do. FMS was field-tested in Singapore in conjunction with the Singapore Land Transport Authority\u2019s (LTA\u2019s) Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) 2012. The pilot recruited more than 1500 users and produced a large set of rich and detailed travel/activity data, validated by the respondents (9). This paper reports on the exploratory analysis of this unique dataset, demonstrating the capabilities of this kind of survey platform to reveal interesting and diverse user day patterns and overcome some of the known issues of traditional travel surveys. The remainder this paper has five parts. Section 2 gives an overview of the FMS system. Section 3 describes the field test with the HITS survey in Singapore and the data collected. Section 4 presents an example to illustrate the difference between the data collected in HITS and FMS. Section 5 presents the exploratory analysis results and the final section concludes. FMS SYSTEM FMS consists of three separate, but inter-connected, components: the smartphone app that collects the sensing data; the server that includes the database as well as the data processing and learning algorithms; and the web interface that users access to view and validate the processed data and answer additional questions to supplement the validated data. Figure 1 shows three components and the data flows among them. Zhao, Pereira, Ball, Kim, Han, Zegras, Ben-Akiva 4 Smartphone App The smartphone app, available for both Android and iOS platforms, collects data from a multitude of the phones\u2019 sensors, including GPS, GSM, accelerometer, and WiFi. A major design objective of the FMS app is non-intrusiveness, i.e., the app runs in the background of the phone, silently collecting sensor data without user intervention. This aims to minimize the app\u2019s influence on participants during their normal daily activities. In addition, the application is designed to be lightweight (in terms of memory use), easy to use, and energy efficient, using various approaches to minimize battery consumption (10), a major concern for location-based applications. The sensor data collected on the phone are transferred to the back-end server through either the cellular network or WiFi, based on the user\u2019s preference. Backend Server Raw data collected via the app are uploaded to a database where a series of algorithms are used to process the data and make inferences about stops, travel modes and non-travel activities (11). To minimize the user\u2019s interaction burden, the backend algorithms translate raw data into trips and activities. The first round of stop detection is made based on location and point-of-interest (POI) data. GSM, WiFi and accelerometer information are used to merge stops that would otherwise be interpreted as distinct stops. Travel modes are detected based on GPS and accelerometer features, as well as public transit location information. Short duration stops that are unimportant from a data validation standpoint (such as stops in traffic) are deleted for the purposes of presentation in the web interface. Travel destinations (e.g., home, work, shopping, drop-off) are also inferred based on previous validations by the user, POI data, and other contextual information. Web-interface The web interface provides a platform that enables users to review and \u201cvalidate\u201d their processed data in the form of a daily timeline or activity diary (Figure 2). Validation involves filling in missing information and amending incorrectly inferred data about modes of travel used for particular trips and specific activities engaged in at inferred \u201cstop\u201d locations (destinations). The validated data are uploaded and the algorithms learn from the user validations to subsequently make better inferences. The website is flexibly designed to enable supplementary data collection, such as information pertaining to a specific trip (e.g., how many people the user traveled with or what, if any, fee was paid for parking), during the activity diary validation stage. The LTA pilot involved a helpdesk made available to users through a web-chat or phone call; users were encouraged to have a session with a helpdesk representative for assistance during their first data validation.", "year": 2016}

This is referred to as \u2018distributed cognition\u2019. Increasingly, network approaches are being explored in attempts to model team distributed cognition. The specific domain of interest in the present study is the sociotechnical system within a maritime control room. This comprises human, machine and software agents interacting to interpret sensor data in order to develop a timely and accurate picture of surrounding contacts at sea. To achieve the goal, information is shared or integrated across the maritime control room consoles. The aim of this study was to develop and apply a suite of workload, situation awareness and team performance measures, including network analysis techniques, to examine how the distributed cognition of a team might change as a function of console configuration and information integration within a control room, and how these changes, if any, impact overall team performance. Sixteen teams of six novices conducted two one-hour scenarios operating generic maritime control room positions. Each team completed a one-hour simulation in each of two console configuration layouts with the order counter-balanced (within-subject design). Half the teams conducted the two scenarios in a high integration condition, and half in a low integration condition (between-subjects). The human machine interface (HMI) designs for the high integration condition emerged from a series of task analyses and user-centered design workshops. The emergent cognitively \u2013oriented HMI designs are based on the assumption that each console can freely share information with other consoles. To create an analogue of current, less-integrated, and more stove-piped systems, a low integration condition was created where not all information was shared across consoles, but instead was shared verbally by console operators. Contacts detected at sea were introduced into the simulation and the team\u2019s task was to assess, report and derive a solution (location, course, and speed) for each detected contact. Individual situation awareness was measured through the Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM) and individual workload through the Air Traffic Workload Indicator Task (ATWIT). Team interaction from the scenarios were video recorded and we applied the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) approach to examine the task, social and information networks which emerged. Team performance was measured as the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions We found higher information integration lowered average team workload, and improved average team situation awareness and team performance (faster solutions and a more accurate tactical picture). We found no impact of console configuration on team performance or any other dependent measure. The EAST method uncovered patterns in the network analysis that are potentially explanatory for the team workload, situation awareness and performance findings as a function of the information integration manipulation. This experiment showed that there can be reductions in workload, and improvements to situation awareness and performance when information is shared between consoles in a considered design. This has implications for HMI design within a team setting. The set of diagnostic metrics developed were largely effective in examining teamwork and team performance. Acknowledgements.

Internet World statistics (2014) indicate that the number of active (those who spend at least one hour per week online) users rose to about 3 billion in 2014. Similarly, the eMarketer report reveals Business-toConsumer forecasts of total world e-commerce sales will hit about 1.5 trillion in 2014 (Nielson, 2014). International Data Corporation (IDC) projects e-commerce ICT spending to grow 3.8% in 2015 to 3.8 trillion. (IDC, 2014). The report also indicates that business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) segments of the online market will drive e-commerce growth. According to United State Census Bureau 2014, total e-commerce sales for United States for 2012 were estimated at $1.8 trillion, up from a revised $1.7 trillion in 2011. Total retail sales in 2012 were $227 billion, an increase of 14.7% from $198 billion in 2011. Based on the foregoing, this paper examines electronic business use in Nigerian financial firms using the technology-organizational-environmental framework (TOE). Electronic business (e-business) is often regarded as generally focused on e-commerce, however, the true definition is much broader. The Aberdeen Consulting Group defines e-business as the automation of the entire spectrum of interactions between enterprises and their distributed employees, trading partners, suppliers and customers. E-business encompasses the application of electronic systems to transform functional processes (Xu, Rohatgi, & Yangxing, 2007). Both definitions include a broad range of business processes such as multi-entity product design collaboration, electronic product marketing and information sharing, e-commerce sales of product to consumers or between firms or governments, internal business process re-engineering, multi-entity supply chain collaboration and customer relationship management. The operational definition of e-business in this chapter includes all business transactions firms conduct using open standard (e.g., the Internet) and/or closed standard networks (e.g., Electronic Data Interchange EDI). Revenue generated from e-business support and related services grow at a rapid rate in Nigeria, despite the insecurity in online economic transactions. With the liberalization of the telecommunication sector and the introduction of GSM services, experts predict a boom for e-business activities across Nigeria including Lagos. Lagos is the commercial and economic hub of Nigeria attracting key investments in financial activities and information and communication technology (ICT). As the fastest growing industry in Nigeria, the ICT industry is projected to be the next foreign direct investment driver in the next decades. E-business value was $58.1billion in 2013 up 22.9% from USD44.8billion in 2012. (Okoro, 2013). The financial services industry (FSI) is a significant source of development and growth in Lagos. The Lagos corporate sector, especially the financial and oil industries are all expected to experience increased growth in their future EB activities.

At that time, it would have been presumptuous to imagine that the same system, only slightly adapted, would be in regular use, some ten years later, as a font digitization system for the Xerox printer product line.Despite its daily usefulness, the system today [1985] shows sure signs of obsolescence in its performance and many of its implementation details, in both software and hardware. By current standards, however, it still performs quite well, and this endurance is a tribute to the quality of the overall design by Robert Sproull and to the remarkably advanced concepts incorporated in the Alto computer.I will not attempt in this paper to present a comprehensive and detailed description of the operation of the system, which is fully described in a user 's manual [1]. I prefer to give simply an overview of the system, trying to bring a critical eye on the design and the implementation of the software, a point of view now facilitated by time and distance. Before going further, it is important to stress that the system discussed here is an internal system, not a Xerox product, and that all the opinions expressed here are strictly those of the author and only engage himself.General principles and overall organizationIn the Alto system, as in several other systems [2], font production is basically a two-step process, resting on the geometrical representation of a character in outline form.The process is illustrated in Figure 1. It is implemented by two main computer programs. FRED is an interactive graphics program used for defining the geometric outline of characters as mathematical spline curves. PREPRESS is used for creating automatically the appropriate digitized character in the form of a matrix of dots, for a given point size and a given printer (a process called scan-conversion). It is also used for touching up by hand the resulting dot matrix, also called a bitmap. (The DRAW program showed in Figure 1 is marginal to the process.)The whole software was programmed for the Alto experimental workstation, a strikingly original personal computer, designed and built at Xerox PARC [3]. Its general size, performance and configuration (including a high resolution graphics display) made it well suited for interactive graphical interactions and friendly user interfaces relying on visual feedback. It has been the forerunner in a well-followed design trend of high-powered computers which has led to such recent products as the Apollo and Sun computers, the Xerox Star, Apple Lisa office workstations, and the Apple Macintosh personal computer.With the exception of a television camera for scanning type artwork and its associated computer interface. the equipment configuration (portrayed in Figure2) is the standard desk size Alto station in its more recent extended memory version (Alto II), featuring:standard keyboard;the now popular table top pointing device called the mouse ;one or two disk drives with removable cartridges:a connection to the Ethernet local network. allowing direct communication with printers and file storage servers:a black and white graphics display. with a resolution of 600 by 800 dot.Overview of FREDFRED is primarily an interactive graphics editor for creating and modifying 'images ' composed of straight lines and spline curves. In fact, its graphics editing functions are quite general and are not specialized for handling letterform outlines. They include commands for defining, deleting, moving, copying, transforming by symmetry, and redefining lines, curves and pieces of curves. These operations are activated by selection from the main menu and are executed interactively by pointing with the mouse in the drawing area (Figure 3). \u2026", "year": 2016}

In a virtual world, the purpose of store layout is to create an environment that fascinates customers, entices them to spend more time in the store and encourages them to purchase from the store. The accomplishment of a successful retail business relies on a quick response and the adoption of new technologies that simplify the customer\u2019s shopping experience. Virtual stores play a vital role in enhancing the success of a retail business. Nowadays, digital signage is widely used to publicize different store contents. The aim of this paper is to select a distinct layout that can be used in digital signage. To enhance Customer Relationship Management (CRM), digital signage can be installed in various contexts, such as metro stations, shopping centers, airplane terminals, and so on. The proposed system scans the Quick Response (QR) code of a product, and the product then arrives at the user end. The tree, pipeline and guiding pathway layouts are employed in the context of digital signage. A questionnaire is used to determine customers\u2019 opinions on the most efficient layout. The statistical results show that layout significantly affects customer\u2019s behavior. Moreover, human computer interaction can help understand more about the customer\u2019s interaction with digital signage.", "year": 2016}

Our system offers unprecedented high-resolution tracking of hand position and motion characteristics by leveraging spatial and temporal features embedded in the reflected radar waveform. Rather than classifying samples from a predefined set of hand gestures, as common in existing work on deep learning with mmWave radar, our proposed imager employs a regressive full convolutional neural network (FCNN) approach to improve localization accuracy by spatial super-resolution. While the proposed techniques are suitable for a host of tracking applications, this article focuses on their application as a musical interface to demonstrate the robustness of the gesture sensing pipeline and deep learning signal processing chain. The user can control the instrument by varying the position and velocity of their hand above the vertically-facing sensor. By employing a commercially available multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar rather than a traditional optical sensor, our framework demonstrates the efficacy of the mmWave sensing modality for fine motion tracking and offers an elegant solution to a host of HCI tasks. Additionally, we provide a freely available software package and user interface for controlling the device, streaming the data to MATLAB in real-time, and increasing accessibility to the signal processing and device interface functionality utilized in this article.", "year": 2023}

(pp. 3-6)", "abstract": "Amazon is well known for use of e-commerce or shopping online. In its early years, as it attracted more attention they began to take advantage of the increased internet traffic to support its customers more effectively. What attracted people the most was its ease of use or convenience, its fast-accurate search results, the selection of products, low prices, easy/safe transactions, timely customer service, and fast reliable deliveries. This happened because of sophisticated, developed technology used to better serve their customers. With its combination of third-party sellers it created a new experience for customers, helping them to discover new products and create better, more informed buying decisions. Amazon\u2019s dedication to troubleshooting problems, developing solutions, and enhancing customer experience has created a successful and continually improved wed site. They are aggressive in monitoring their web site\u2019s traffic and modifying it accordingly (Bhasin, 2017). Excellence is performed in customer tracking; collecting data every time someone goes on to their web pages. Amazon then takes the collected data and directs the customer to products they might be interested in because of three reasons: It is similar to what the user was currently searching for, it was related to what the user had searched for or clicked on at any time in the past, or it had been purchased by other people who had searched or bought the same item the user was searching for. While Amazon has contended with groups such as Apple\u2019s iPad with their Kindle devices, their main key competitors consists of other e-commerce and Web based companies like eBay and Barnes & Noble. Other competition includes companies that distribute their own digital content like iTunes and Netflix for music and video. Suppliers control the availability of supplies or materials Amazon needs for its ecommerce operations, imposing a powerful force. Price change in items from a small number of large suppliers can directly impact the company\u2019s online retail operational costs. However, moderate forward integration provides little control that suppliers have in the sale of their products to firms like Amazon. So, only external factors emphasize a real moderate significance of suppliers as a strategic determinant in the online retail industry environment. Consumers have access to information regarding the services of online retailers and the products that Amazon sell. With this knowledge, customers can find alternatives to Amazon\u2019s online retail service. Cost of switching to other firms, such as Walmart makes it easy for customers to transfer and find better prices. The high availability of substitutes further empowers consumers to shift from one retailer to another (Greenspan, 2017a, 2017b; Swartz, 2017). Currently, Amazon\u2019s current business model is easily replicable making it easy for new entrants to enter their market. Consumers can easily transfer to new firms with low negative effects, thereby empowering new firms to impose a formidable force against the company. Thankfully, Amazon has created a trusted brand name making it hard for new entrants to perform as well as Amazon. To complete companies would need to invest billions of dollars to create a strong brand that directly competes with the Amazon. So, new entrants are a minor strategic issue in Amazon\u2019s performance in the online retail industry environment. Customers can easily transfer Amazon to other and decide to buy from the store that has the lowest price. There is a high availability of substitutes from ecommerce and local based competitors. The lower the costs of competitor offerings, the further influence increase of substitutes against Amazon. For Amazon to retain long-term success they need to stay focused on the threat of substitutes by keeping their brand reputation up and offer many of its items at a low cost in the online retail industry. Even though Amazon quickly became a major player in the online retail market, they still faced various challenges. One challenge is if the U.S. Supreme Court decides to supersede its decision to not require Amazon to collect state or local sales or use taxes. This would create an administrative burden on Amazon putting it in a competitive disadvantage, especially if similar obligations are not imposed on its online competitors. A decrease in future sales would occur if this plan were to be initiated. Amazon has been trying to make deals to collect sales tax in all 50 states so that it may open warehouses in heavily populated areas so they can provide their same one-day delivery option. This would cause a shift in its business position model causing further competition with stores like Best Buy and Target, as well as other local retailers. Usual threats such as customer preference for instant pleasure/satisfaction always had Amazon rushing to get products in store. This is a downside as amazon must pay costly for its immediate stock rather than waiting several days for the product to be shipped to them. If Amazon were to discontinue this, they would lose their customers to local stores. Trends such as buying local can harm Amazon by losing regular consumers who might decide to buy from their local markets rather than going through an online retailer such as themselves. As of now, Amazon\u2019s current warehouse of distribution capabilities no long provide the competitive advantage they once held. Strategies such as worldwide free shipping and Amazon Prime were effective tools for marketing; however, shipping expenses have been cutting into profits, causing fees up to US$360 million in revenue, only to be slashed by the US$918 million in expenses. There are many questions for management to answer, such as whether to spend money to develop high technology to compete on a larger scale with Sony, Apple, and Samsung, or to stick with its strengths as on online retailer and acquire more holding firms. They also need to answer important questions like, if they should push for more same-day shipping despite added cost and additional competition with big box stores and how to handle counterfeit items being sold on their site. Basically, Amazon uses demographic and psychographic segmentation to segment the markets. Amazon\u2019s segmentation is based on actual purchase behavior, rather than what people might have expressed interest in. Amazon\u2019s segmentation targets each customer individually, allowing the company to convert visitors into long-term, high-value customers. E-commerce segmentation often involves creating personas who will buy in a certain way or certain products. Amazon usually targets the middle and upper class people who have got hands on experience in the basic technology but don\u2019t have time or prefer convenience over shopping from the physical outlets. Majority of these customers are professionals or businessmen who are busy with their business/job and find it convenient to purchase online rather than visiting the physical outlet to save time & money. These customers might also be the ones who are searching for deals. Due to this, the Amazon is known to have specific days where they give huge discounts to their buyers. To further target potential customers, Amazon engages in permission marketing, asking permission to e-mail customers regarding specific production promotions based on prior purchases on the assumption that a targeted e-mail was more likely to be read than a blanket e-mail. This was hugely appreciated by Amazon customers, contributing further to Amazon\u2019s success. In addition, Amazon partnered up with Google by purchasing pay-per-click advertisements on their search engine. This allows products that a user might be interested in to be directed directly to their web site. As customers click on these sponsored ads, Amazon would be charged a fee for each person who clicked and was directed. 1. Pros: Segmentation is based on actual purchase behavior, rather than what people might have expressed interest in to attract customer individually. This helps develop Amazon\u2019s high-value customers. Email promotions are distributed based on prior purchases, having customers more likely to read them compared to pointless products from additional e-commerce sites. Teaming up with Google has brought more awareness to its e-commerce site by offering related products that customers can be taken to so they could purchase them. 2. Cons: Target audience is middle and upper class customers who could be searching for deals. This brings Amazon to lose customers if their product costs more than another e-commerce site or local stores. Also, email promotions are one of the worst ways to promote product awareness, as most people have become tired of vast amounts of spam from the variety of sites they visit. Another con, is that teaming up with Google does not guarantee additional profit. As a user clicks on an advertisement, Amazon pays a fee for each redirect. However, while this is good for product awareness, it does not mean the user is going to buy or love the product. Amazon has successfully positioned itself as a global e-commerce giant where one can buy anything & get it delivered at any remote locations. Using the catchphrase #AurDikhao in its most recent campaign in India, it has further helped them carve a distinct space in the consumer\u2019s mind. Amazon strategically locates its fulfillment centers near airports where rent is cheaper, giving them the advantage of speed and low cost over its competitors. With such a strategic set up, Amazon offers free express shipping to countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. 1. Pros: Fulfillments are strategically placed to allow cheaper cost advantages near airports to allow for speedy shipments across the globe. This can be a huge factor in consumers\u2019 minds. Free shipping can also be the key element is deciding over an additional e-commerce sites that could have a larger shipping cost for certain produ", "year": 2017}

This project was called \u2018Homies\u2019. In order to achieve their goal of reducing burglary costs, the Homies team created a concept for an in-home alarm system that warns a network of neighbours, family and friends through messaging service WhatsApp whenever it is triggered. Homies\u2019 working method is based on the \u2018Lean Startup\u2019 method: their aim was to start as soon as possible with releasing \u2018minimum viable products\u2019 (MVPs) to their (potential) customers and end users. Housing corporation Ymere agreed to participate in pilots, and facilitated the contact with its tenants. For this graduation project, I was able to use Homies\u2019 pilots to test my own interventions and gather insights. Context Break-in-and-entering in homes is a problem of substantial size in the Netherlands, in which socially deprived neighbourhoods suffer disproportionally. There are many stakeholders that are negatively affected by it, among whom victims and their neighbourhoods, governmental institutions, insurers and housing corporations. From my research on how Homies could address this problem, I discerned three major challenges: 1. Decreasing damages from break-in and burglary 2. Availability for social tenants 3. Promoting social cohesion Research process As the Homies concept was already being developed and tested in a pilot at the start of my graduation project, it seemed worthwhile to research the prototype in use, as well as its pilot users. My process consisted of interviews, observations, interventions, simulations with end users and creative sessions. The insights that I gained during this research, were in some cases directly used to alter the Homies concept and prototype (MVP). At the end of this process, I had contributed to an increase in the amount of neighbours that are warned for each alarm from less than one to 5 on average, helped boost the responsiveness of neighbours after an alarm fired and reduce the average time it took to assess if it was false alarm to below three minutes in 90% of the cases. Key redesign factors My research led me to believe that Homies\u2019 mission and vision for its product and service have clear merits, but there are many factors that could impede success. I defined five key redesign factors, based on my research insights. I addressed these in a redesign for Homies\u2019 service, that focuses mostly on a new interface that is meant to replace WhatsApp. 1. Guide users through alarm situations Departing from the very limited possibilities for guiding alarm situations in WhatsApp, creating a new interface for users during alarm situations opens up many opportunities for Homies to guide their users in the best possible way. The redesign was specifically made to only give each user information that is relevant to them in that exact moment, and to suggest very specific actions that would lead to effective follow-up. Each view of the app is specifically designed to guide the user in taking their next step. As a significant part of the target group (social tenants) are low-literate, have little experience with technology and mobile phones and are insecure about their capabilities, I aimed for a design with decreased dependence on reading and writing skills, opting to always give users a few clear options for their next action, enhanced with as many visual cues as possible. 2. Provide better insight and oversight for users and Homies By creating a new interface, social translucence can be taken into account specifically. Users will then be better able to work together and account for each other\u2019s needs in the situation. Next to this, each button-press or other interaction within the concept can be captured by Homies and used towards understanding both user behaviour and the specific conditions of each alarm situation, which can be of great value for improving their service: the behaviour of individual users can be tracked back in more detail. Additionally, all aggregated data can be used to show trends and patterns in both user behaviour and alarm situation specifics. Homies can collect statistics on user, home and neighbourhood level and build a system of positive reinforcement for its end users around improving scores. 3. Reduce dependence on third party apps Progressive web apps (PWAs) have the potential to solve Homies\u2019 WhatsApp dependency and improving the alarm follow-up user experience, while also omitting the necessity for a native Homies app for each different smartphone OS. 4. Show users the value of Homies as integral part of the user journey This custom interface that guides users better during the alarm situation, can easily be used during the onboarding process to simulate alarm situations. These simulations could provide a perfect environment for users to be prepared for alarm situations. 5. Engage users effectively over long time spans It is important to keep users effectively engaged throughout their Homies membership, as it is important that, in each alarm situation, enough alarm group members engage in follow-up behaviour, otherwise Homies can\u2019t effectively decrease burglary and fire damages. The onboarding process is designed following the effective engagement model that Yardley et al. (2016) propose: behaviour change is mediated by the digital behaviour change intervention (DBCI), where in the first phase, the DBCI prepares the user for behaviour change in a set of \u2018micro\u2019 level moment-to-moment engagements that keep the user come back to the DBCI. Throughout these micro level engagements, the DBCI aims to get the user to identify and engage with the larger intervention goals, which reinforce the user\u2019s motivation to keep engaged on the micro level. The combination of these levels of engagement can then in turn bring the behaviour change about, onto a point where continued engagement with the DBCI is not necessary to keep the behaviour change.", "year": 2017}

The accuracy of the feedback force describing the error between the actual feedback force felt by a user at the master side and the measured interaction force at the slave side is the key performance indicator for haptic display in robotic teleoperation. In this paper, we evaluate the haptic feedback accuracy in robotic teleoperation via experimental method. A special interface iHandle and two haptic devices, iGrasp-T and iGrasp-R, designed for robotic teleoperation are developed for experimental evaluation. The device iHandle integrates a high-performance force sensor and a micro attitude and heading reference system which can be used to identify human upper limb motor abilities, such as posture maintenance and force application. When a user is asked to grasp the iHandle and maintain a fixed position and posture, the fluctuation value of hand posture is measured to be between 2 and 8 degrees. Based on the experimental results, human hand tremble as input noise sensed by the haptic device is found to be a major reason that results in the noise of output force from haptic device if the spring-damping model is used to render feedback force. Therefore, haptic rendering algorithms should be independent of hand motion information to avoid input noise from human hand to the haptic control loop in teleoperation. Moreover, the iHandle can be fixed at the end effector of haptic devices; iGrasp-T or iGrasp-R, to measure the output force/torque from iGrasp-T or iGrasp-Rand to the user. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the output force from haptic device iGrasp-T is approximately 0.92 N, and using the force sensor in the iHandle can compensate for the output force inaccuracy of device iGrasp-T to 0.1 N. Using a force sensor as the feedback link to form a closed-loop feedback force control system is an effective way to improve the accuracy of feedback force and guarantee high-fidelity of feedback forces at the master side in robotic teleoperation.", "year": 2022}

Generally, social media is a collection of online social platforms that enable users to share information, ideas and interests and to interact via the internet or mobile systems such as smartphones (Ates, 2013; Neti, 2011; Richter & Koch, 2007). The online social platforms include chat rooms, discussion forums, location services, social networking, social guides, social bookmarking, social status networks, weblogs, blogs, podcasts, video casts and wikis. Keller (2009) notes that social media facilitates more rapid and effective information dissemination to consumers than traditional media such as TV, radio and print advertisements. This is Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 3 April 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 114 because brand communication is created and disseminated through user-generated social media communication by consumers themselves. More importantly, their reviews or comments about brands quickly generate a buzz and have the tendency to affect consumer buying behaviour (Wolny & Mueller, 2013; Genseler et al., 2013). For instance, Facebook fan pages have become a credible information source for consumer reviews of brands and their products and services (Obal, Burch, & Kunz, 2011). In fact, about 70% of internet users trust the evaluations of consumers on social media platforms (Nielsen, 2009) and these online reviews have been shown to impact firm performance (Genseler et al., 2013). Brand equity is an important concept for understanding the objectives, mechanisms and the net impact of marketing efforts (Reynold & Philips, 2005). Aaker (1991) defines brand equity as a set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name and symbol that add to or subtract from the value provided by a product or service to a firm and/or to that firm\u2019s customers. According to Yoo and Donthu (2001), brand equity marks the difference in consumer choice between the focal branded product and an unbranded product given the same level of product features. Hence, brand equity generates value for consumers and helps brands create defensible competitive positions that cannot be easily transferred to other brands (Pitta & Kastsanis, 1995). Brands have resorted to several strategies including advertising, sales force, public relations, slogans and symbols in the attempt to develop brand equity (Aaker, 1991). Yazdanparast et al. (2015) opine that social media-based marketing activities tend to be an effective marketing strategy to build brand equity in this digital era. Consequently, brands have incorporated social media marketing into their marketing strategies to build lasting relationships and connections with consumers (Erdogmus & Cicek, 2012). Social media marketing is the process of promoting products and services via online social channels and platforms (Weinberg, 2009) through content generation, communication, outreach and referrals to increase web traffic, awareness and popularity of brands (Kim & Ko, 2012). As noted earlier, social media is fast becoming the preferred source of information about products, services and brands for consumers. Consequently, Ha (2015) reports that there are over 40 million active small business pages on Facebook. Moreover, social media forms a key component of the marketing and brand management strategies of global companies with strong brand identities, such as Coca-Cola, Starbucks, JP Morgan Chase etc. (Morrissey, 2007). Developing economies have witnessed phenomenal growth in social media presence, and Issaka (2015) reports that the most visited website in Ghana is Facebook, ahead of local news sites and even the search engine giant, Google. It is not surprising, therefore, that telecommunication network operators in Ghana have created Facebook pages to provide consumers with up-to-date information on their products, services, promotions and values with the intent to promote positive word-of-mouth as consumers are able to share their experiences with the brand in their immediate online social communities. But does the strong social media presence and associated social media marketing activities of the network operators generate any form of return on investment or brand equity? It is important, therefore, to examine the nature of consumer engagement within interactive online social settings on a brand\u2019s ability to generate equity (Yazdanparast et al., 2015) in Ghana\u2019s telecommunications sector. Facebook fan pages have become a credible information source for customer reviews of brands and their products (Obal et al., 2011). Hence, this paper investigates the social media marketing effect on brand equity of network operators using Facebook to answer the following questions: (i) does social media marketing create brand equity in Ghana\u2019s telecommunications sector? and (ii) which social media marketing activities create brand equity in Ghana\u2019s telecommunication sector? 2.0 Literature Review 2.1 Social Media and Marketing In recent years, the rise of a new generation of information and communication technologies, which are collectively referred to as Web 2.0 or social media, has been phenomenal. They are propelling a new wave of fostering innovation and creating intellectual capital creation (Faraj, Jarvenpaa & Majchrzak, 2011). Kaplan and Haenlein (2010) define Web 2.0 as a new way in which end users use the World Wide Web; a place where content is continuously altered by all operators in a sharing and collaborative way. Web 2.0 has evolved from simple information retrieval to include interactivity, interoperability, and collaboration (Campbell et al., 2011). Social media thus comprises of Internet based applications that build Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 3 April 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 115 on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and allows the creation and exchange of user generated content (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). To meet the requirements as a social network platform, a site must contain user profiles, permit users to connect with others and post comments on each other\u2019s pages, and join virtual groups based on common interests (Gross & Acquisti, 2005; Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe, 2007; Lenhart & Madden, 2007; Winder, 2007; Boyd & Ellison, 2007 as cited in Cox, 2010). The emergence of social media platforms facilitates consumer-to-consumer communication and accelerates communication especially between unknown consumers (Duan, Gu & Whinston, 2008). In a study conducted by Nielsen (2009), it was noted that 70% of internet users trust the evaluations of consumers on social media platforms. As a result, marketers can expect that brand communication will cease to be generated solely by the company, but increasingly by the consumers themselves through usergenerated social media communication. As a result, social media enables word-of-mouth communication from consumer to consumer in the online environment. Considering that consumers are increasingly reliant on their social networks when making purchase decisions (Hinz, Skiera, Barrot, & Becker 2011), social media word-of-mouth among consumers is crucial for brands as it is faster and more far-reaching than traditional word-of-mouth. Social media is increasingly becoming both a communication and m", "year": 2019}

They also cause less damage to vessel wall compared to tube-cutting stents. However, poor performance of VBS or suboptimal operation can give rise to unwanted clinical situations such as thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia. Therefore, research on designing factors affecting the performance of these devices is of great significance. Furthermore, simulation of stenting process can help designers understand the interactions of stents and vessel wall to reduce time to market. Thus, finite element analysis (FEA) and bench test are performed taking into account both designing factors and stenting process of VBS, including development of parametric modeling tool, research on the relationships among structural parameters and radial force, exploration of the interactions of VBS and vessel wall and pulsating load effect. This research was performed using a commercial solver Abaqus/standard with a user material subroutine (UMAT/nitinol). Structural parameters of VBS, unit-cell height and wire diameter have significant impacts on radial force, unit-cell number has slight influence on radial force, and arc diameter has almost negligible impact on radial force. Without pulsatile load, maximum stress and strain always occur in arc position; however, in pulsatile load, maximum stress and strain are gradually transformed to strut position. The stress created near vessel wall and VBS interface is higher than interaction stress due to pulsating load. The obtained result provided valuable information on the structural design of stents as well as the effects of stent on vessel wall and that vessel wall on stent deformation.", "year": 2022}

One of the cafes named Kopi KurangLebih has great potential to attract customers due to its strategic location, high-quality menu, and aesthetic ambiance. Although Kopi KurangLebih already has an Instagram account to showcase its content and engage with followers, the information provided is limited and lacks proper organization. Visitors to the coffee shop struggle to make menu choices due to the absence of a platform to display the available options. To address these challenges and improve the quality of service, a website is needed to document and present information that assists customers in making menu selections.

The public health debate about risks and benefits of e-cigarettes currently focuses on 2 groups: adult smokers and youth nonsmokers (1). The health benefits of current smokers completely switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes may be enormous. However, uptake of e-cigarette vaping by adolescents could lead to initiation of cigarette smoking. In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-cigarettes, concern that vaping is a gateway to smoking may overlook a more likely outcome: Teenagers who vape may never switch to smoking but will become nicotine-dependent adults who vape. Using data from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Mirbolouk and colleagues (2) report a low prevalence (1.4%) of e-cigarette use by adults without a history of combustible cigarette smoking (that is, sole e-cigarette users). This translated to approximately 1.9 million U.S. adults solely using e-cigarettes. Another recent study using data from the National Health Interview Survey showed that current e-cigarette use by U.S. adults decreased from 3.7% in 2014 to 3.2% in 2016 (P= 0.02) except among never-smokers, whose use increased from 0.4% to 0.7% (P= 0.02) (3). In Mirbolouk and colleagues' study, most sole e-cigarette users were young, male, and likely to report high-risk behaviorscharacteristics similar to those of combustible cigarette smokers (2). These findings suggest that some young adults may initiate use of e-cigarettes in lieu of combustible cigarettes, but it is impossible to know how many sole e-cigarette users eventually transition to combustible cigarettes using data from cross-sectional surveys, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Observational studies of adolescents and young adults suggest that sole e-cigarette use is associated with future smoking (4), yet observations of e-cigarette use before 2017 may not accurately reflect what is happening today. The JUUL vaping device, introduced in 2015, now accounts for more than 72% of e-cigarette sales and is quickly changing the riskbenefit debate about e-cigarettes. JUUL has a sleek design (the smartphone of e-cigarettes) with a battery device that can be charged with a Universal Serial Bus port and prefilled pods offered in flavors, such as creme and mango. It uses a proprietary electronic liquid that delivers nicotine at higher levels than most other e-cigarettes. One pod is the nicotine equivalent of a pack of cigarettes. Although JUUL's stated mission is to improve the lives of the world's one billion adult smokers, a large increase in retail sales between 2015 and 2017 coincided with the company's innovative marketing campaign using social media (such as Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube) to promote concepts like lifestyle, relaxation, and sex appeal (5). An unofficial report of national data from 2018 indicates that use of e-cigarettes by high school students increased 75% in 2018 compared with 2017 (6). This unprecedented rapid rise prompted U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to declare an epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers (7). What does a teenage epidemic mean for the next generation of young adults? Nicotine is the drug in tobacco responsible for addiction. Under the gateway theory, a teenage e-cigarette epidemic would lead to increased prevalence of combustible cigarette smoking; however, with novel vaping technologies that deliver high doses of nicotine efficiently and cleanly, the gateway theory may be outdated. A recent online poll revealed that two thirds of teenagers who vaped believed that vaping could be part of a healthy life (6). Youths who become nicotine dependent using a sleek device that delivers high-dose nicotine have no need or desire to switch to dirty, unhealthy combustible cigarettes. The health risks of long-term e-cigarette use by adult never-smokers are largely unknown. Although less toxic than combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes provide long-term exposure to heated and aerosolized liquids. The consequences of this exposure are not understood but probably include some health-related effects (8). The adverse effects of nicotine on a developing fetus and adolescent brain are well described. However, long-term exposure to inhaled nicotine by adults has unknown risks, because observational data about nicotine exposure in the absence of smoking are lacking (9). Nicotine increases heart rate, myocardial and coronary vascular contractility, and insulin sensitivity, but no conclusive evidence shows a causal effect on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. Even if health risks are minimal, nicotine dependence from vaping may have individual-level social, psychological, and economic costs. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, defines tobacco use disorder as a problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, including tolerance; withdrawal; time spent in activities necessary to obtain or use it; and interference with obligations or important activities at work, school, or home (10). Although such policies are not consistently enforced, many workplaces, schools, and businesses restrict e-cigarette use in buildings and on campuses. Therefore, nicotine-dependent users may need to take regular vaping breaks that interfere with work or other activities or may experience prolonged periods without vaping that cause psychological distress due to withdrawal. The economic cost of a regular JUUL habit is similar to that of a 1-pack-per-day smoking habit. For these reasons, nicotine-dependent e-cigarette users may want to stop. Quitting is especially important for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Clinicians have little to no guidance on treating e-cigarette dependence. Most electronic health records systematically capture information about combustible tobacco, but not e-cigarettes. At Massachusetts General Hospital, the tobacco treatment program has already received referrals for teenagers who are vaping. Although assuming that some smoking cessation medications (for example, nicotine replacement therapy) may be effective for quitting e-cigarettes is reasonable, whether other agents (for example, varenicline) have a role is less clear. Clinicians should screen and counsel patients about all nicotine products, including e-cigarettes. Future research is needed to determine effective treatments to help vapers quit. Although data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and National Health Interview Survey show that the prevalence of sole e-cigarette use by adults was relatively low in 2016, we must not ignore the early warning signs of a growing youth epidemic in 2018. History shows that nicotine-dependent teenagers become nicotine-dependent adults. Prevention of e-cigarette uptake by youths is the key to reversing this epidemic, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now taking stronger actions (7). However, to the extent that this train has left the station, the medical and public health communities must start to address e-cigarette use by young adult never-smokers through screening, education, and treatment and pursue research to understand the risks of long-term exposure to e-cigarettes.", "year": 2018}

We evaluate our model by means of an online experiment (n\u2009=\u2009408) using a website with different configurations of nature imagery. The results provide support for our theoretical model and hence confirm a positive influence of nature presence, that is, the extent to which the website allows a user to experience the natural environment as being present, on trust, visual aesthetics, and purchase intentions. Thereby, user perceptions of nature presence are specifically linked to nature imagery depicting water as well as vegetation.

Therefore, the cross-domain recommender system, which analyzes user information from both the user\u2019s familiar and unfamiliar domains, has become an important emerging subject of research. Weighted irregular tensor factorization (WITF) has been proposed as an algorithm to leverage cross-domain feedback across all users and considers the dataset as an irregular tensor containing different items for each domain. According to tensor theory, an irregular tensor must be transferred into a regular tensor (in which each domain contains the same items), before executing tensor factorization to obtain the user's latent factors. Therefore, WITF must assign a weight on each domain to ensure minimal data loss during the transformation. Searching for the optimal domain weight configuration is a complex and time-consuming procedure. Thus, WITF adopts an empirical domain weight configuration. In this study, we propose a model that combines Apache Spark\u00ae and a genetic algorithm to search efficiently for the optimal domain weight configurations for WITF, and then uses the optimal configuration obtained to generate more precise users\u2019 latent factors to make recommendations. Experimental evaluation using two datasets of different sizes show 4.2% and 6.3% higher accuracies in comparison with the WITF alone 1. Intorduction With the development of the Internet, the number and variety of content on the World Wide Web continue to increase, and user demand is higher for searches and recommendations. Recommender systems, which make accurate and personalized recommendations using users\u2019 preferences, interests, and experiences, have become more and more important and are widely used in many fields. Collaborative filtering (CF) [1] is the algorithm most utilized in recommender systems, and it has been used in many applications, including Amazon and Netflix. However, the data sparsity problem (many users do not have data in the CF recommender systems) always affects the performance of CF recommender systems. In general, users always have sufficient experience in their focused domains. In some researches, the recommender system uses data from other domains to supply more data, and thus generates more accurate recommendations. Therefore, the cross-domain recommender systems, which leverage cross-domain feedback data across all users to learn the user's latent factors, have become an important emerging research topic. Weighted irregular tensor factorization (WITF) [2] is a model that considers cross-domain information by considering the multiple domains dataset as an irregular tensor. In this model, a weight must be assigned to each domain to ensure minimal data loss after transferring into a regular tensor, followed by processing the tensor factorization to make recommendations. However, the WITF model adopts an empirical domain weight configuration that decides the weight based on the number of items in each domain. Therefore, a method for selecting the optimal weight configuration for the WITF model is necessary to improve its performance. Genetic algorithms [3] are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems. Furthermore, the WITF model and genetic algorithm are suitable for parallel processing. For this, Apache Spark [4] is a powerful distributed computing framework that has become an important part of the big data analytics ecosystem. This study focuses on combining the WITF model with a genetic algorithm on Spark to search for the optimal weight configurations for making more accurate recommendations and reducing the execution time. 2.

When information from users\u2019 familiar domains is used as auxiliary data, recommender systems perform better at recommending potentially desirable items in domains unfamiliar to users. Thus, cross-domain recommender systems have become an important emerging subject of research. Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CDCF) [5] is an important subject of research that focuses on product domains. Product domains, time domains, spatial domains, and other domains are also adopted in research related to CDCF. Because matrix factorization (MF) is a widely used model of CF recommender systems, cross-domain matrix factorization (CDMF) [6] has been proposed as an improvement technique for the CDCF method. 2.2 Irregular Tensor Factorization In CF recommender systems, a dyadic user\u2013item relationship is considered a core relationship. To use additional data, such as tags and time, some studies adopt tensor factorization (TF) [7] to process the triadic relationships, e.g., user\u2013item\u2013tag, user\u2013item\u2013time. Tensor factorization has two models: Candecomp/Parafac (CP) [7] decomposition and Tucker [7] decomposition. As shown in Figure 1, CP decomposition decomposes a tensor into a sum of component vectors, e.g., Ui,:, Ci,:, and Vi,:, of the three latent factor matrices U , V, and C . Compared to CP decomposition, Tucker decomposition decomposes a tensor into one core tensor g and three latent factor matrices, e.g., U , V, and C . Figure 1. Two models of tensor factorization To adopt the two models, the tensor must be a regular tensor with each of its domains containing the same items. Unfortunately, almost all real-world datasets cannot be considered as regular tensors with the same items in each domain. These datasets can be considered as irregular tensors, each of whose domains contain specific items. As shown in Figure 2, it is necessary to transfer the irregular tensor into the regular tensor that has the same set of virtual items. However, during the transfer, data loss is inevitable [2]. Therefore, it must be ensured that the data loss is minimal because the origin data from the irregular tensor is to be utilized maximally, and the most accurate latent factors are then obtained by processing the factorization for the regular tensor that has been transferred from the irregular tensor. We define this kind of irregular tensor factorization as lossless irregular tensor factorization, where lossless represents the minimal data loss while transferring an irregular tensor to a regular tensor. Figure 2. Irregular Tensor Factorization 2.3 Genetic Algorithm Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired genetic operations such as mutation, crossover, and selection. These bio-inspired operators can be processed in parallel to speed up the operation. To improve the algorithm, researchers have refined each bio-inspired operator. For example, roulette wheel selection [3] and tournament selection [8] have been proposed to improve the selection operator. Binary mutation and Gaussian mutation [9] have been proposed to improve the mutation operator. Decades after the genetic algorithm was proposed, it is still widely used. 2.4 Apache Spark Although MapReduce has been successfully implemented in large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters, some other applications are not suitable for MapReduce. These applications contain many iterative machine learning algorithms that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. Thus, the new Spark framework distributed by Apache, to support these applications. Spark contains two main new features, which retain the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. They are resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) [4] that save data on memory and various parallel operations. The architecture of a Spark cluster contains three components: Spark driver program, cluster manager, and Spark workers. The Spark driver program converts the user \u2019s applications into tasks and schedules, then sends these tasks to Spark workers. The cluster manager manages the resources of whole clusters as a Spark plugin, and Spark can run different external cluster managers. A Spark worker contains several executors, which have multiple cores (\u2265 1 ), to execute tasks and return the results to the Spark driver program. 3. Related Work 3.1 Weighted Irregular Tensor Factorization (WITF) Hu et al. proposed a weighted irregular tensor factorization (WITF) model [2] to leverage cross-domain feedback data across all users to learn users' latent factors that are more accurate than users' latent factors only in a particular domain. Epinions dataset [10], which is used to evaluate WITF, contains multiple domains, with each domain containing different items. WITF considers the dataset as an irregular tensor in which each domain contains different items and then executes tensor factorization to obtain the user's latent factors. According to tensor theory, the irregular tensor must be transferred into a regular tensor, in which each domain contains the same items, to execute the tensor factorization. Due to the inevitable data loss in irregular tensor transformation, the WITF model utilizes a set of domain weights to reduce the data loss as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3.

Integrating it with online drug sales can deeply understand the properties of drugs and realize personalized recommendations based on molecular information, which is of great significance in the intelligent analysis system and the improvement of user experience. The latest research works apply the mask-based model to represent the molecule graph and achieve great success in molecule graph representation. However, Existing mask-based molecular graph representation methods can only randomly mask single nodes, and cannot mask key functional groups in the molecular graph as a whole. This causes the mutual information of the key features of the molecule to be lost, limiting the further improvement of the performance of the molecular graph representation. To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel molecular graph representation method that uses motif vocabulary to mask critical functional groups to complement the defining mutual information of the molecular graph. First, the functional groups are discovered by motif vocabulary. Then, the discovered functional groups are masked randomly from the original graph. After, our method effectively learns a molecular graph encoder, which is enhanced by more discriminative node-node and graph-graph cross information. At last, massive experiments show that the graph representation information output by our method can be better used for downstream molecular graph classification tasks.

The independent variable (online advertising) has been divided into five dimensional segregations: informativeness (INFO), irritation (IRR), entertainment (ENT), incentives (INC) and credibility (CRD). For increasing the value of investigation to further extent, the authors included two mediators termed as flow experience (FE) and advertising value (ADD).Design/methodology/approachThe study has been conducted on primary data collected through a structured questionnaire received from a valid sample of 281 smartphone users selected on a random basis. SPSS (Version 24) has been used for descriptive statistical analysis, while structural equation modeling technique (utilizing AMOS 24) has been used to test the hypothetical relationships among the variables.FindingsAfter a careful and bias-free statistical analysis, the results indicate that purchase intention is positively and significantly affected by all the independent components INFO, IRR, ENT, INC and CRD. Regarding the mediating effect, FE can partially mediate the relationships between IRR and PI and ENT and PI as both the direct and indirect effects are significant. On the other hand, ADD can partially mediate the relationships between IRR and PI and INC and PI, respectively, since both the direct and indirect effects are significant.Research limitations/implicationsThis empirical study is expected to be beneficial for the academicians in finding some unique dimensional aspects regarding online advertising and purchase intentions.Practical implicationsThe policymakers can formulate some unique online advertising policies with a view to identifying customer psychology and increase sales volume based on the findings.Originality/valueSmartphone market in Bangladesh is growing steadily. This empirical paper has shed some lights on the unique role of online advertising on PI of smartphones of Bangladeshi customer base.

Keywords\u2014Martial arts shoes; Mass customization design production; 3D printing; Shoe design I. CONCEPT OF MASS CUSTOMIZATION After the Industrial Revolution, the concept of mass customization is proposed to massively produce for modern enterprises. \u201cMass\u201d production means products batch, products standards and products patterns, all following the same pattern, and \u201ccustomization\u201d means unique, small production. Mass customization is a combination of two contradictory phenomena, to find the balance of contradictory things, which requires enterprises to design not only for the need of customers but also massive produce [1-3]. II. ANALYSIS ON CONSUMER DEMAND OF MASS CUSTOMIZATION A lot of focus from consumers is brought by the customization service provided by enterprises. But usually consumers would shrink back at the sight of high price which results in the mass production in one pattern; people in the circle of subcultures would cares a lot on expression and pursuit of culture on their own style, such as geek culture consumers, who go after extreme experience on technology while mass product could not satisfy their thirsty to technology, and they want to live in the world of technology when they are asked to choose shoes type. When these consumers' needs cannot be met from one brand, they will look for the next brand that can meet their needs [4-5]. At the same time, it is common to see for consumers in this situation: when he is interested in the style and color of shoes, but the function could not meet his need, so when there are enterprises can achieve the mass customization production and therefore, you will also have a lot of customers. Mass customized production could bring the maximum profit, make the products achieve single-digit differentiated production, so as to improve the product value, acquire data of consumers\u2019 need, enhance the users experience and better build the brand reputation. In America, about 25% customers shopping online are looking for the customization shoes, and the total sales amount of all of shoes customization in America is up to about 2000 million US dollars. Together with mass application of computer design and 3D printing technology, the development of mass customization of shoes products would be boosted in the future. III. ANALYSIS ON CASES OF MASS CUSTOMIZATION Puma company started to try customized sport shoes \u2013 \u201cMongolian Shoe BBQ\u201d in 2005. Consumers can get their shoes in the colors they matched by themselves by choosing different colors in shoe laces [6-7], upper and soles. Initial customization is merely color changing with long time spending which is far away from meeting the need of mass customization. Fig. 1 Mongolian Shoe BBQ \u201cCreative Factory\u201d was built by Puma company in 2010, where consumer can customize two classic Puma shoes by selecting materials by themselves in the store ---First Round and Basket. Compared with the \u201cMongolian Shoe BBQ\u201d, the upgraded points of \u201cCreative Factory\u201d is that different material can be selected and all later design comments are operated online to improve the consumers experience. However, these customized shoes are too small in scope with too little choice. Adidas Originals launched customization plan of 12 shoes styles with Japanese famous street fashion shoes store Styles in 2010. At the same time, XLarge, SILAS and MILKFED also joined the plan together. Consumers can choose different color to match and also can select different material to match, which International Conference on Management, Education Technology and Economics (ICMETE 2019) Copyright \u00a9 2019, the Authors.

Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to design and implement a recommendation system capable of identifying suitable products and forecasting the purchase frequency for various product combinations, while also integrating this recommendation system with a smart shopping platform. To achieve this objective, the research employs machine learning techniques, specifically content-based filtering and the Apriori algorithm. Content-based filtering is utilized to analyze user preferences and behavioral patterns related to visited products, while the Apriori algorithm is employed to evaluate support and confidence values for item set combinations, thereby generating frequency values for future transactions involving product combinations. Additionally, a smart shopping system is developed and integrated, enhancing the shopping experience through smartphone applications and streamlining the payment process to facilitate seamless product purchases. The research methodology involves data collection pertaining to products and user preferences, followed by several testing involving a sample group of user respondents. The results demonstrate that the developed recommendation system effectively delivers relevant product recommendations based on user preferences, achieving a confidence value up to 98%.

Controlling these drones, especially in tight spaces, using \u2018line of sight\u2019 or a \u2018first person\u2019 view from the perspective of the drone can be a difficult task. Often users experience an increased rate of difficulty that can be traced back to the limited situationaloverview of the user. To investigate whether a different form of visualization and interaction might result in a higher level of usability for the user, an experimental workspace was set up, with the goal of exploring the possibility of implementing a \u2018third person view\u2019 metaphor, like one used in video games. To further allow the user to experience his environment the use of virtual reality was used to stream the followers perspective directly to the users headset. This allowed the user to fly inside a simulated environment allowing for a control- and repeatable testing ground of the software. The workspace consisted of a simulation in which a \u2018proof of concept\u2019 was developed. In this simulation a drone used a conventional GPS sensor to follow a human controlled drone, offering his view, from a static camera, as a third person perspective to the controller using a virtual reality headset. Within the framework of the project, two aspects in particular were investigated: The performance of the technical system and the basic user experience and ergonomics of this form of interaction. To evaluate the performance of the follower system, the GPS position, as well as execution times and latencies were recorded. The user experience was evaluated based on personal interviews. The results show that the developed system can in fact follow a drone based on the GPS position alone, as well as calculate the desired positions in a timely manner. Yet, the existing delay in movement induced by the controller execution, as well as the drones own inertia did not allow for continues camera tracking of the drone using a static camera. This introduced several issues regarding tracking and impacted the user experience, but still showed that such a metaphor could in theory be implemented and further refined. The personal interviews showed that users would try tracking the drone by moving their head, like they are used to in virtual reality games. Ultimately, it was deduced that introducing a vectorbased drone movement, additional range detection sensor, as well as a moveable camera, controlled via head movement would be next steps to improve of the overall system. Since the prototype created in this paper only contained a bare bones user interface and experience the use of a usability study has been foregone in exchange for a more stable software solution. This allows further research into this topic the possibility of evaluating possible types of spatial user interfaces, which could improve the user immersion.", "year": 2023}

Modern types of Internet communications are capable of acting as a virtual interlocutor, repeating and reproducing a written set of human signs, providing a programmed answer to the questions asked. Chatbots use conversational intelligence as a new user interface for e-commerce applications and, accordingly, have significant advantages over other sales channels, increasing sales, improving end-customer service and significantly reducing costs. According to Juniper Research, the total number of chatbot messaging applications available worldwide will grow from 3.5 billion in 2022 to 9.5 billion by 2026. A Ukrainian team of experienced specialists in the construction industry and IT developers developed a chatbot called BMBOT, which is aimed at the digital transformation of the construction industry using artificial intelligence, starting from communication with customers and ending with the collection and analysis of sales data. The article describes the features and capabilities of the chatbot, as well as the advantages of using it for customers and businesses. The authors showed a schematic diagram of a chatbot for a company - a supplier of construction goods, using the example of the selection and calculation of construction materials for the installation of a laminate floor. A chatbot can be developed for all types of system products. This project will be of interest to suppliers, as they will be able to convey to the client important differentials of their products, such as environmental friendliness, European standards, cost efficiency, ease of use, and others. Through the chatbot, you can form a complex customer order with the possibility of delivery, which will save the buyer's time and finances. For the seller, the use of a chatbot will facilitate communication between the client and the supplier, solve the problem of shipment and delivery of goods, and reduce the time and money spent on processing the client. The costs associated with the implementation and use of a chatbot include the initial investment in the creation of the platform and the ongoing costs of maintaining the messaging service. But these costs will be covered by the benefit received in the process of using the chatbot. Conclusions and directions for further research. The advantages of using a chatbot by trading companies: optimization of sales processes, increased decision-making efficiency, assessment and analysis of the target audience, which will lead to cost savings, increased customers, increased conversion, turnover and margins. For further research into the prospects of using chatbots in business, it is necessary to more actively introduce this digital tool into e-commerce of various fields of activity, collect information about the advantages and disadvantages of using chatbots, and improve the theoretical and methodological base of digital marketing and e-commerce.", "year": 2022}

First, it examines influence of gamification on the behavioral intention to use an e-commerce platform. Second, it analyzes the role of the flow state given its importance in terms of behavior in online environments. Finally, the study aims to detect and analyze differences between Millennials and Generation X.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe theoretical basis for this study stems from technology acceptance model. The extended model incorporates gamification and the optimal state of intrinsic motivation, flow state, as additional constructs. An online consumer panel was used to collect data from 253 Spanish Amazon users. A structural equation modeling, partial least squares, is proposed and multi-group moderation was studied.\n\n\nFindings\nGamification in Millennials has positive and significant indirect effects on behavioral intention through the flow state. In the case of the Generation X, it has been detected that flow interferes in its perception of ease of use. The behavioral intention of using the Web page is directly correlated with the purchase intention. Companies should offer a fun interface to Millennials and an environment easier to use to the Generation X, for gamification to be successful.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study expands the research scope in gamification by focusing on e-commerce sector, a field where scientific research is still scarcely developed.

One challenge for a successful employment of electric mobility represents the provision of sufficient charging points for large fleets. In this context, public charging systems play an essential role to provide access for a broad range of users. Standard technology today is manual charging by plug-in and plug-off the charging cables. This has drawbacks in view of safety, user comfort and limited access of persons with disabilities. In addition, cars are parked for a longer duration at charging stations so that they block access for other electric cars, and manual charging does support future automated driving and parking vehicles.The proposed article introduces a selection of automated charging technologies for cars and discusses their strengths and weaknesses for application in public areas. This includes inductive charging, conductive charging from the vehicle underbody and conductive charging by use of standard connectors. Based on a value analysis, robot-supported conductive charging by use of standard connectors is selected as the preferred solution for automated charging processes under consideration of investment costs, avoidance of specific vehicle adaptations and easy customer handling. The potentials of this technology to enhance existing charging infrastructure are discussed based on an existing research prototype of a robotic automated charging station. The discussion comprises aspects of charging system integration in urban and sub-urban infrastructure, operational boundary conditions as well as requirements for safe and reliable system usage. In addition, an outlook is given to the operational integration of automated driving and parking cars and the automated charging system with the target to optimize the operational load of the charging infrastructure, e.g. in public parking areas. One main target of investigation represents the enhancement of user experience during the automated charging process. This includes the provision of smooth user interaction by a smart phone application and on-site interfaces, the guidance of the car to the right parking position, as well as provision of information about the actual charging status and billing data. In this way, the article introduces a comprehensive approach of automated robot-based charging of electric cars with the target to improve both user experience and the effectiveness of charging infrastructure utilization.", "year": 2023}

For this application, the accuracy of the decoding of movement intentions is crucial. We aim to improve accuracy by designing a better encoding model of primary motor cortical activity during hand movements and combining this with decoder engineering refinements, resulting in a new unscented Kalman filter based decoder, UKF2, which improves upon our previous unscented Kalman filter decoder, UKF1. The new encoding model includes novel acceleration magnitude, position-velocity interaction, and target-cursor-distance features (the decoder does not require target position as input, it is decoded). We add a novel probabilistic velocity threshold to better determine the user's intent to move. We combine these improvements with several other refinements suggested by others in the field. Data from two Rhesus monkeys indicate that the UKF2 generates offline reconstructions of hand movements (mean CC 0.851) significantly more accurately than the UKF1 (0.833) and the popular position-velocity Kalman filter (0.812). The encoding model of the UKF2 could predict the instantaneous firing rate of neurons (mean CC 0.210), given kinematic variables and past spiking, better than the encoding models of these two decoders (UKF1: 0.138, p-v Kalman: 0.098). In closed-loop experiments where each monkey controlled a computer cursor with each decoder in turn, the UKF2 facilitated faster task completion (mean 1.56 s vs. 2.05 s) and higher Fitts's Law bit rate (mean 0.738 bit/s vs. 0.584 bit/s) than the UKF1. These results suggest that the modeling and decoder engineering refinements of the UKF2 improve decoding performance. We believe they can be used to enhance other decoders as well.", "year": 2016}

The device, which does not require any complicated tethering cords, is not expected to be sold as a consumer product. Rather, Intel plans to work with developers to build their own headsets based on its hardware\u2014a move that defines the direction emerging technologies must take in order to combat the fragmentation that faces applications in healthcare technology. At the 22nd Annual CyberPsychology, CyberTherapy and Social Networking Conference (CYPSY22) held June 26\u201328, 2017, a perennial topic proved inevitable: in order for applications and software to truly flourish, it is necessary to develop a robust infrastructure that enables widespread adoption and allows applications to work without the need of a separate peripheral device or software package. As recently as 2016, the most realistic headsets for virtual reality therapies in clinical settings, such as the Oculus Rift, cost a minimum of $600 for hardware alone\u2014a price that limits mainstream adoption among patients, clinicians, and researchers. However, developments are promising, as key players in the virtual reality/augmented reality space\u2014such as Microsoft\u2019s recent partnership with HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer, and ASUS\u2014create technologies that are more powerful, user-friendly, and compatible with more cost-effective computers. Facebook\u2019s move into augmented reality echoes this sentiment. In April 2017, CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke at F8 about the need for these technologies to support open source platforms in order to become truly part of the mainstream ethos over the next 5\u20137 years. To that end, Bloomberg Intelligence projects that the market for virtual and augmented-reality hardware may exceed $40 billion in sales by 2020. Between the growing prominence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and the advent of mixed reality, it follows that an infrastructure designed to support these technologies would need to reduce costs, improve function, and eliminate usability issues that hamper immersion, such as latency. Cloud computing may offer a compelling solution. Cloud computing\u2019s benefits are twofold: it addresses the technological limitations and cost of tethering headsets to PCs, and it opens up room for monetization models that reflect actual consumer usage of virtual reality. As Bob O\u2019Donnell states in an April 2016 article on Tech.pinions, virtual and augmented reality applications will soon demand greater digital bandwidth than modern computers can offer at a reasonable price. \u2018\u2018Rather than forcing rapid and costly upgrades to the base computing devices used for VR/AR,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Donnell wrote, \u2018\u2018a cloud-based service can more easily enhance the speed of its core infrastructure and pass those benefits along to users of the service.\u2019\u2019 Additionally, given the rapid pace of development exhibited by virtual and augmented reality devices, cloud computing would invite a more seamless delivery of system updates. There\u2019s a larger benefit to cloud computing that may belie the vision of virtual and augmented reality. While Google Glass suggested that augmented and merged realities would soon become part of our all-day wear, usage patterns indicate that we are far from that reality. At CES, Samsung celebrated the sale of five million Gear VR headsets, stating that people had viewed more than 10 million hours of content since its November 2015 launch. However, the Application Resource Center noted that \u2018\u2018this usage amounts to an average of two hours per person. Not per day, week or month. But total.\u2019\u2019 Consumers, clinicians, and even loyal gamers do not use virtual and augmented reality applications regularly. Cloud computing invites a subscription service model that better captures how people interact with these technologies, thereby lowering the obstacle of a large investment upfront and creating a far more accessible entry point. In terms of widespread impact across industries, a May 2017 Pew Research Center report by Lee Rainie and Janna Anderson quoted Tawny Schlieski, research director at Intel, as saying, \u2018\u2018New technologies of human/computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education.\u2019\u2019 Namely, augmented and virtual reality tools invite entire experiences, engaging students with physical movement and enabling \u2018\u2018interactive and responsive instructional assets.\u2019\u2019 Over the next decade, radical changes in training and workforce development are expected, which will eventually impact traditional institutions of higher learning. In the interim, the report identifies online courses as being poised to benefit from advances in augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.

The method can ensure high algorithm execution efficiency and detection accuracy while ensuring high robustness. Introduction In the environment of the current virtual reality, the man-machine interaction is mainly divided into three categories. The first category, interaction based on data glove. Using the sensor which is connected to the gloves to convert finger movements to electrical signal so that the gestures can be determined; the relative position of the finger is determined by the additional sensor that is usually connected to magnetic or acoustic related sensors attached to data glove. Using the data glove and location tracker have high recognition rate of in measuring the trajectory of gestures in space motion y and temporal information, but the system requires users to wear complex data gloves and position tracker, causing some inconvenience to users, and currently the input device is expensive, posing difficulties upon massive promoting; The second category is mouse, keyboard, touch screen based interaction.

The rule has been so implicit in the field of design as to allow for no debate. However, the idea that perfect collinearity creates an advantage for either search or recall has rarely been tested. Drawing from separate branches of cognitive literature, we tested a minimal brainstorming interface with either aligned or eccentrically arranged layouts on 96 college students. Incidental exact recall of recently worked locations improved in the eccentric condition. And in both conditions there were frequent near-miss recall errors to neighboring aligned objects and groups of objects. Further analysis found only marginal performance advantages specifically for females with the eccentric design. However, NASA-TLX subjective measures showed that in eccentric, females reported higher performance, less effort, and yet also higher frustration; while males reported lower performance with about the same effort, and lower frustration. Figure 1. (a) Aligned experimental arrangement. (b) Eccentric experimental arrangement. Running head: Alignment May Interfere With Location Recall 2 1 BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW Two-dimensional (2D) interactive interfaces are the worldwide norm, and there are no signs that they will be supplanted in the near future. Today, displays range in size from wristwatches to building walls; however, for interaction the hand-eye metaphors are largely consistent, regardless of the particular application or input device. This stands to reason: limited screen real estate; limited 2D range of motion and direct gestural correspondences of the several input hardware solutions; and a desire not to confuse users, all leave HCI designers with a limited available solution space for object display and subsequent selection. Of prime importance is how users find and interact with these objects in screen space, as well as how to implement the greatest possible state-persistency for later location recall of material. This calls for a discussion of screen layout current practice. 1.1 Early HCI prescriptions for screen layout While this is not an exhaustive review, one can briefly claim certain prominent anchoring references regarding practice for HCI screen layout. The tradition began approximately with Tullis (1981; see Tullis, 1984 for a review). Tullis placed particular emphasis on the work of Gui Bonsiepe (1968), who had drawn on notions from cybernetic science idealizing mathematical order and control using the Shannon complexity formulae (for an HCI context, see Comber & Maltby, 1996). To Bonsiepe and later researchers, good design was orderly design. Order, in turn, was simplicity indicated by reduced variation and increased alignment \u2013 so to say, uniformity \u2013 and presumed to accord with overall greater readability (Tullis makes Bonsiepe\u2019s comparison; see Figure 2). By the late 1980\u2019s, this tradition had been imported into the province of the graphical user interface (GUI) or soAlignment May Influence Location Recall 3 called WYSIWYG practices. This was intended to address concerns over an increasing complexity of layouts (Parush, Nadir, & Shtub, 1989; Parush, Schwartz, Shtub et al., 2005; Galitz, 1996; but see a contradiction in Comber & Maltby, 1996). However, until 1996, no actual effort had been made to confirm whether complexity theory in fact extended to more complex GUI interfaces (Comber & Maltby, 1996). What research was done, was on fairly simple pages (Comber & Maltby, 1996; Parush, Nadir, & Shtub, 1989; Parush, Schwartz, Shtub et al., 2005). Figure 2. Bonsiepe (1968), his Figures 3 and 4, pp. 210-211, showing before and after for his efficiency algorithm. According to cybernetic theory and Shannon\u2019s complexity model, the right-hand design is preferable to the one on the left, as it is simpler and more spatially ordered. However, many distinctive spatial cues prevalent in the left, which could later aid memory, are sacrificed. As to visual search, it is theoretically possible that aligned layouts such as that on the right may in fact be the most efficient possible. But as to item location recall, cognitive literature would seem to favor the left-hand layout due to its unique spatial qualities. Which is more likely to have its elements\u2019 locations recalled for later reference, alleviating the work of visual search? (From Bonsiepe, 1968; reprinted with permission of the publisher) 1.2 Web era and saliency models Soon after, in a closely related vein, Faraday (2000) developed a set of guidelines for object saliency in webpages that claimed an order of priorities for object attributes based on Gestalt principles. He found that they favored motion (e.g., animation), followed by size, image, color, text emphasis, and finally screen position, which last he considered a neutral factor. Although only supported by a case study as evidence, this model gained widespread 1 An acronym for \u201cwhat you see is what you get.\u201d Alignment May Influence Location Recall 4 influence that is still standard teaching (e.g., Djamasbi, Siegel, & Tullis, 2010; Masciocchi & Still, 2013; Stone & Dennis, 2011). This trend emphasizes saliency due to such devices as strategic use of color (Hamborg, Bruns, Ollermann & Kaspar, 2012; Rumpf, Boronczyk, & Breuer, 2019), animation and color (Breuer & Rumpf, 2015), and possibly personalization (Stiglbauer & Kovacs, 2018). Although the Faraday model gave rise to these widespread practices, various weaknesses called it into question. For example, one study found no strong support for any of the original findings, also finding that object location was in fact an important factor (Grier, Kortum, & Miller, 2007). This helped usher in a period of focus in web research on popular locations for standard objects, such as logos and login menus. Still and Masciocchi (2012) claimed that, at least for interaction design, attentional models focused too much on top-down attention, short-changing efforts to understand the workings of bottom-up attention, in particular aspects of local contrast (Hicks, Cain, & Still, 2017; Itti, Koch, & Niebur, 2005). By top-down they were referring to goals and expectations; in other words, computational predictions about simple goal attainment (e.g., a user\u2019s need to change an object\u2019s color). They used this to articulate a computational attentional model based instead on bottom-up saliency and local contrast. Still 2018 \u2013 in a direct critique of the Faraday model \u2013 actually found deficiencies in its ability to predict visual entry points and also found that it overemphasized size as a key factor. Still went so far as to call Faraday\u2019s model misleading and to urge designers to discontinue its use. He found that both spatial position and distinctiveness can predict earlier attention engagement, arguing that user expectations and visual salience were more important. Memory for an object\u2019s previously learned position is an important aspect of user expectation. Furthermore, as graphic designers understand implicitly, object distinctiveness or salience is not limited to internal features of the object itself, but can be strongly regulated solely by the space surrounding the object and without Alignment May Influence Location Recall 5 any change to internal features. This applies both to the global position as well as local space pertaining to the object, which space both inflects it and is inflected by it. And so the memory for an object\u2019s location will not only have global spatial properties (\u201cit was somewhere in the upper-right corner\u201d), but will also have local properties relative to nearby objects (\u201cit was between these two objects and yet slightly below them\u201d). The above studies focused on web design. Here we should acknowledge that web browsing, both as a general cognitive activity and as a specific spatial-temporal navigation modality, differs in many aspects from such activities as screen-based editing, simple menu selection, information visualization, or EBS, and that these semantic differences can involve somewhat different types of goals and expectations and therefore perhaps somewhat different visual search strategies for web work than for other activities. However, while acknowledging these semantic distinctions, at the same time we take it as a given that, assuming our task is certain memory-aided search goals for content on presented displays, most of the human visual system and object location memory at the basic level should operate in much the same way irrespective of specific content type. This should be particularly true if we are speaking simply of retrieving a previously user-interacted object and not of some higher-level activity. Within such a limited frame, we are examining the bridge between simple object retrieval goals and attentional aspects of object saliency, processes far closer to the sensory-perceptual than the reflective. Furthermore, the majority of relevant HCI research done in the last 20 years has focused on web page design. And so although memory is addressed only in a limited way, we still find this line of research instructive for the present work due to its focus on the salient features of an interface that will ultimately encourage stronger memory encoding for later retrieval. Although this general trend may have been an advance over simpler global contrast and pure bottom-up models, this in turn caused a distraction away from other potentially Alignment May Influence Location Recall 6 important aspects of top-down or endogenous control, such as that based on memory of previous scenes. This is something that computational models in general do not tend to address. However, a fundamental but underexamined component of design contrast is not only the internal features of objects, but also the contrast in space between objects.

The potential benefits and challenges of touch screen technology on flight decks was investigated by means of a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods (mixed methods approach). A number of research questions are addressed, which have been iteratively developed from the literature, interviews with avionics experts and pilots. This work presents one field study, two lab studies, one observational study, one simulation study and one comparative user study, all investigating various factors/variables that could affect touch screen usability on the flight deck. \n \nThe first field study investigated interactive displays on the flight deck with search and rescue (SAR) crew members in an operational setting in helicopters. This was the first in-flight experiment where touch screens were evaluated under real conditions. The results showed the impact of target size, device placement and in-flight vibration on targeting accuracy and performance. Presented statistical analyses and observations are essential to understand how to design effective touch screen interfaces for the flight deck. \nOne of the lab studies evaluated (more in depth) the potential impact of display position of touch screens within a simulated cockpit. This was the first experiment that investigated the impact of various display positions on performance following Fitts\u2019 Law experiment. Results revealed that display location has a significant impact on touch screen usability. Qualitative findings from semi-structured interviews and post-experiment questionnaires supported the understanding of interactional issues on a flight deck environment which extended initial design guidelines. \n \nPilots brought attention to the impact of increased G-force (+Gz) as an additional environmental factor that might affect touch screen usability on agile aircrafts. Therefore, a Fitts\u2019 law experiment was conducted to understand the effect of +Gz on touch screen usability. +Gz conditions were simulated with a weight-adjustable wristband, which was the first approach to simulate increased G-force in lab environment. Empirical results and subjective ratings showed a large impact of +Gz on performance and fatigue indices. \n \nAn observational study focused on Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) (mobile device) usage on the specific domain of Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters. The novelty in this study was the focus group in which the aim was to find features, content and functionality that a SAR pilot may wish to see in an EFB. From operational observations and interviews with pilot\u2019s operational requirements were defined. A Digital Human Modelling Software was used to define physical constraints of an EFB and develop interface design guidelines. A scenario and virtual prototype was created and presented to pilots. \n \nA new way of interaction to manipulate radio frequencies of avionics systems was developed based on findings achieved in this work and other relevant studies. A usability experiment simulating departures and approaches to airports was used to evaluate the interface and compare it with the current system (Flight Management System). In addition, interviews with pilots were conducted to find out their personal impressions and to reveal problem areas of the interface. Analyses of task completion time and error rates showed that the touch interface is significantly faster and less prone to user input errors than the conventional input method (via physical or virtual keypad). Potential problem areas were identified and an improved interface is suggested. \n \nOverall, the main contribution of this research is a framework showing the relation between various aspects that could impact the usability of touch screens on the flight deck. Furthermore, design guidelines were developed that should support the usability of interactive displays on the flight deck. This work concludes with a preliminary questionnaire that can help avionic designers to evaluate whether a touch screen is an appropriate user interface for their system.", "year": 2017}

Extending Fisher\u2019s inequality to coverings Daniel Horsley School of Mathematical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia danhorsley@gmail.com A (v, k, \u03bb)-design is a collection of k-element subsets, called blocks, of a v-set of points such that each pair of points occurs in exactly \u03bb blocks. Fisher\u2019s inequality is a classical result that states that every nontrivial (v, k, \u03bb)-design has at least v blocks (equivalently, has v \u2265 k(k\u22121) \u03bb +1). An elegant proof of Fisher\u2019s inequality, due to Bose, centres on the observation that if X is the incidence matrix of a nontrivial design, then XX is nonsingular. This talk is about extending this proof method to obtain results on coverings. A (v, k, \u03bb)-covering is a collection of k-element blocks of a v-set of points such that each pair of points occurs in at least \u03bb blocks. Bose\u2019s proof method can be extended to improve the classical bounds on the number of blocks in a (v, k, \u03bb)-covering when v < k(k\u22121) \u03bb + 1. Specifically, this is accomplished via bounding the rank of XX , where X is the incidence matrix of a (v, k, \u03bb)-covering, using arguments involving diagonally dominant matrices and m-independent sets in multigraphs. A Tale of Universal Cycles in Two REU-Environments Anant Godbole Department of Mathematics and Statistics, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN 37614 godbolea@etsu.edu I regularly supervise undergraduate research projects as part of my tenured position at ETSU, where we require undergraduate research of all our majors via the course MATH 4010. At the same time I have run an NSF-sponsored REU site during most years since 1991. This talk will outline the symbiotic nature of these undertakings. I will provide concrete examples of how great NSF-REU work led to important work by an ETSU undergraduate and, conversely, how a project started in MATH 4010 led to important REU work in the summer. In both cases, the students in question were working on Universal Cycles, introduced into the literature by Chung, Diaconis, and Graham. Edge colouring multigraphs Penny Haxell Combinatorics and Optimization Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada pehaxell@uwaterloo.ca While edge colouring in graphs is well understood (by Vizing\u2019s classical theorem), the chromatic index \u03c7\u2032(G) of a multigraph G can fall anywhere in the range [\u2206(G), 3\u2206(G)/2] (where \u2206(G) denotes the maximum degree of G), or in terms of the maximum edge multiplicity \u03bc(G) the range [\u2206(G),\u2206(G)+\u03bc(G)]. We discuss results showing that if \u03c7\u2032(G) is significantly larger than \u2206(G), then G contains a small subgraph that is very dense. This idea is at the core of the famous open problem of Goldberg and (independently) Seymour, which seeks to identify the properties of G that influence \u03c7\u2032(G). 3-Flows with Large Support Jessica McDonald Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36830 mcdonald@auburn.edu Tutte\u2019s 3-Flow Conjecture says that every 4-edge-connected graph should have a nowhere-zero 3-flow. The 4-edge-connectivity assumption cannot be weakened\u2014K4 is an example of a 3-edge-connected graph that does not have a nowhere-zero 3-flow. However, K4 is minimal in the sense that K \u2212 4 has a nowhere-zero 3-flow. Since K4 has 6 edges in total, this means that we are able to give K4 a 3-flow in which 5/6 of the edges are nonzero. With DeVos, Pivotto, Rollova, and Samal, we can show that this is the worst case in general\u2014that is, if G is any 3-edge-connected graph, then G has a 3-flow with support size at least 56 |E(G)|. As a corollary, this implies that every planar graph has an assignment of three colours to its vertices so that at most a sixth of its edges join vertices of the same colour. Hamilton decompositions Barbara Maenhaut School of Mathematics and Physics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia b.maenhaut@uq.edu.au The problem of partitioning the edge set of a graph into Hamilton cycles is a classical problem, with results dating back to the work of Walecki in the 1890s. Over the last 50 years, much work has been done on several open conjectures and problems that deal with Hamilton decompositions of certain families of graphs. I will survey some of this work and discuss a few recent developments, especially on Hamilton decompositions of vertex-transitive graphs, line graphs, and infinite graphs.

Combinatorial-based Pairwise Event Sequence Generation for Automated GUI Testing of Android Apps David Adamo*, Ren\u00e9e Bryce Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203 DavidAdamo@my.unt.edu Mobile apps are Event-Driven Systems (EDS) that often rely on Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) as the primary means of interaction with end-users. These systems are tested using event sequences that exercise the system\u2019s functionality while covering as much of its source code as possible. In this work, we develop a greedy pairwise approach to automate event sequence generation for Android app testing. The proposed approach dynamically traverses an app by identifying and executing GUI events that maximize the coverage of pairwise event combinations. We implement two variants of a greedy pairwise algorithm. The first considers the order of the event pairs while the second one does not. We conduct experiments on five Android apps by comparing the proposed approach to random event sequence generation. The results show that given the same parameters, test suites generated using a greedy pairwise approach tend to achieve higher block coverage than test suites with randomly generated event sequences. The results also show that pairwise test suites tend to find a higher number of faults than randomly generated test suites. However, the results show that there was no significant difference between pairwise test suites generated using ordered pairs and pairwise test suites generated using unordered pairs in terms of block coverage and number of faults found. On Enumeration of Paths in Catalan\u2013Schr\u00f6der Lattices Max A. Alekseyev Department of Mathematics, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052 maxal@gwu.edu We address the problem of enumerating paths in square lattices, where allowed steps include (1, 0) and (0, 1) everywhere, and (1, 1) above the diagonal y = x. We consider two such lattices differing in whether the (1, 1) steps are allowed along the diagonal itself. Our analysis leads to explicit generating functions and an efficient way to compute terms of many sequences in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, proposed by Clark Kimberling over a decade and a half ago.

Avoiding subsystems in cycle systems John Asplund*, Michael Schroeder, Venkata Dinavahi Department of Technology and Mathematics, Dalton State College, Dalton, GA 30720; Department of Mathematics, Marshall University, Huntington, WV 25755; Department of Mathematics, University of Findlay, Findlay, OH 45840 jasplund@daltonstate.edu A k-cycle decomposition of G is a partition of the edge set of G such that each element of the partition induces a k-cycle. If G = Kn then it is called a k-cycle system of order n. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a k-cycle system of order n have already been determined. We aim to take this one step further. We will show how minute changes to systems can impact the structure of the k-cycle system in interesting ways. In particular, this talk will show there exists a k-cycle system P of order n such that no subset of P forms a k-cycle system of order t where 2 < t < n and both n and k are odd; if we can show this, we say that P contains no subsystems. The Symmetric Arctic Rank of Boolean Matrices and the Clique Covering Content of Graphs LeRoy B. Beasley Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322-3900 leroy.b.beasley@aggiemail.usu.edu Let G be a simple undirected graph on n vertices and let A = A(G) be the (Boolean) (0, 1) adjacency matrix of G. Let \u03c1sa(A) be the minimum |B| over all possible factorizations of A of the form BB for some (Boolean) n \u00d7 k (0, 1) matrix B and some k where |B| denotes the number of nonzero entries in B. This function, \u03c1sa(A), is called the symmetric arctic rank of A. Let C(G) denote the set of all clique covers of G, and let C(G) be the minimum over C(G) of sum of the orders of the cliques composing the clique cover. This function, C(G), is called the clique cover content of G. It is shown that C(G) = \u03c1sa(A(G)) and some properties and problems are presented. On Path-Hamiltonian Tournaments Zhenming Bi Department of Mathematics, Western Michigan University, zhenming.bi@wmich.edu A Hamiltonian graph G is j-path Hamiltonian if every path of order j can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle of G. The Hamiltonian extension number he(G) of G is the largest integer k such that G is j-path Hamiltonian for every integer j with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Hamiltonian extension in graphs has been studied. Here, we study corresponding concepts for Hamiltonian tournaments. Results and open questions are presented in this area of research. This is joint work with F. Fujie and P. Zhang.

However, the devices are currently not suitable for interactions within large virtual spaces because of their limited workspace. We developed a novel gaze-based kinaesthetic interface that employs the user\u2019s gaze to relocate the device workspace. The workspace switches to a new location when the user pulls the mechanical arm of the device to its reset position and gazes at the new target. This design enables the robust relocating of device workspace, thus achieving an infinite interaction space, and simultaneously maintains a flexible hand-based kinaesthetic exploration. We compared the new interface with the scaling-based traditional interface in an experiment involving softness and smoothness discrimination. Our results showed that the gaze-based interface performs better than the traditional interface, in terms of efficiency and kinaesthetic perception. It improves the user experience for kinaesthetic interaction in virtual reality without increasing eye strain.", "year": 2020}

Recent prevalence in table-top games have increased production and sales for the game industry, thus providing a large variety of table-top game options to users. The volume of table-top options available to users, however, is problematic as buying new, unfamiliar games is a risk, since purchase cannot guarantee play satisfaction, and 100% refunds are not warrantied if game components have been tampered with.

The aim of the article is to improve the scientific approaches to the formation of the communication policy in the Internet. \nThe results of the analysis. It is justified that Internet marketing should be considered in two dimensions: for intangible products or services delivered through the network and for tangible products or services in the real world. Internet marketing is a kind of marketing communications, which provides a set of activities for its own organization methodology: media advertising, contextual advertising, search engine optimization(SEO), social media marketing(SMM), direct marketing, public relations(PR), including search engine reputation management(SERM), mobile marketing, sponsorship, partner marketing. The problem of evaluating the effectiveness of digital marketing is connected with the concept of the conversion funnel, that is, the fact of the transition of the audience from the category of visitors to the category of consumers and the visualization of successive stages of the conversion process. It is indicated that a permanent competitive analysis should be aimed at assessing the quantitative and qualitative indicators of the relevant channels, successful and unsuccessful elements or activities. The classification of sites is offered. It is stated that the concept of marketing communication on the Internet is based on the following principle: the user initiates the communication process and produces feedback, which is expressed in the targeted actions. Users choose to follow the link or the banner, and which search requests to send, which results to pay attention to, what pages and content are relevant. \nConclusions and direction for further research. Justified the hierarchy of building business goals for the selection of tasks and tools for marketing communications. It is precisely this hierarchy that should define tasks that will be relevant to the functionality of a web page in the context of attracting an audience, staying, and implementing targeted actions, using the call-to-action functionality. The stages of the Internet marketing strategy are identified: the definition of the target audience, needs and ways to meet them; setting of marketing communication tasks; definition of the main indicators (metrics) formation of messages of advertising campaigns; selection of tools and channels of promotion; creating an online promotion plan. \nIdentified methods for measuring the effectiveness of marketing activities in the network: CTR or click-through rate ; CPC or cost-per-click; CPA or cost-per-action; CPS or cost-per-sale; CAC \u2013 the cost of attracting a client(Customer Acquisition Cost). Indicators for monitoring audience activity in social networks are identified: metrics: the number of community members; number of posts; SMA \u2013 audience activity(Social Media Analysis); ER \u2013 the indicator of attraction(Engagement Rate); cost of customer acquisition; the company's profit received from one client for the entire period of cooperation with it (LTV-Lifetime Value indicator) is the return from one client in relation to how much it cost (LTV: CAC).

The ATI \u2018Whole Aircraft\u2019 team responsibilities include providing whole aircraft impact assessments for research funding proposals, strategic guidance on future market and aircraft developments as well as maintaining and developing the whole aircraft skillset within the UK. The small Whole Aircraft team, formed in 2015, has a strong industrial, research and operational background. It is in the process of establishing the capability to model the performance and economics of civil conventional and less conventional transport aircraft, business aircraft, helicopters, general aviation and RPAS. The conventional aircraft modelling is now functional using conceptual design tools of differing fidelity levels. This includes the Pacelab APD software including local knowledge capture as well as Excel based aircraft scoping and economic tools for exploring gross changes in Top Level Aircraft Requirements. Further work is planned to enhance the capabilities of these tools. All of these are deliberately intended to avoid any intensive computing processes at runtime given the extensive database of existing conventional aircraft. An engine performance model has also been developed to support this work. It provides suitable engine performance and ratings data based on limited public domain data. The less conventional aircraft capability is in development. It will use the same APD tool with extensions to the data model to consider various types of configurations. Development of aerodynamic and mass methods will use limited scope CFD/FE/MDO research studies or the results of literature searches to populate the data model with response surfaces. This capability will also be used to identify the necessary technologies and required improvements to deliver the necessary whole aircraft improvements to realise these configurations and assess their feasibility. The Aerospace Technology Institute The Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) is at the heart of civil aerospace research and development in the UK. The Institute is dedicated to ensuring the UK\u2019s civil aerospace technology strategy reflects the scale, vision and ambition of the sector by working collaboratively with industry, government, academia and the wider aerospace community. The ATI\u2019s mission is to help UK organisations realise that there is an opportunity for the UK to capture a valuable share of the growing global civil aviation market. The Institute recently launched its Technology Strategy and Portfolio Update (2016), which builds on the ATI\u2019s first UK aerospace technology strategy published in July 2015. The document, titled 'Raising Ambitions', is an ambitious long-term plan to maximise the UK's share of the global commercial aircraft market. Investment into aerospace technology through the ATI delivers powerful benefits to the industry and its complex supply chains \u2013 up to 115,000 UK aerospace and supply chain jobs will be created and safeguarded through this investment. ATI Whole Aircraft Team Early in the establishment of ATI, the board recognised the need for a Whole Aircraft team. Consequently, the function was established at the beginning of 2015 with the current team of 3 engineers/analysts formed by mid-2015. The team has a strong industrial, research and operational background concerning the Whole Aircraft and engines. Figure 1: The ATI Whole Aircraft team The team responsibilities can be summarised as: i) Inputs to ATI Strategic initiatives (ATI) \u2013 Given that technology development will ultimately have to demonstrate a benefit that \u2018buys its way\u2019 onto an aircraft programme, it is important to understand the aircraft market (current and future) and the competitive positions between different aircraft models and concepts. The Whole Aircraft tool set and understanding provides the necessary insight to allow the broader ATI team can draw conclusions on the market. ii) Assessment of the technical and economic potential of technology development projects applying for UK government research funding is a fundamental ATI responsibility. In addition to assessing the managing individual proposals, the Whole Aircraft team provides aircraft level assessments for any other projects when required. iii) The provision of Whole Aircraft knowledge, analysis and skills for the UK Aerospace sector where there is limited or no in-house capability, particularly in the UK supply chain. Specific tasks include providing whole aircraft impacts for technology improvements being considered, often by SMEs. Complex changes due to new technology can be assessed using the ATI detailed aircraft sizing/design tools. Such changes impact specific elements of a mission to a greater extent than others or significantly alter the fundamental aircraft characteristics. Relatively straightforward changes to aircraft weight, drag or engine SFC can be addressed using ATI generated performance (block fuel and design range) exchange rates generated by the ATI aircraft sizing tools. The options for delivering this capability to the UK aerospace sector are currently being explored. The initial trades will focus on \u2018fixed trades\u2019 (block fuel and range impacts associated with fixed aircraft geometry) although \u2018rubber\u2019 trades (aircraft and engine scaling effects included) will be considered in the future. Understanding of future technology requirements for transport aircraft and rotorcraft including, where appropriate, linking these to the ACARE 2050 goals. An important ATI objective is to support and co-ordinate medium and long term technology development that requires an understanding of the potential platforms to which the technology may be deployed. iv) Preservation and development of UK Whole Aircraft understanding. This will be achieved by maintaining a central ATI capability that is available to the UK aerospace sector, coordinating the existing capability across the UK aerospace sector as well as encouraging high quality Whole Aircraft teaching at undergraduate and post graduate levels. It is also important to maintain an understanding of non-UK technologies that may significantly impact the direction of future aircraft development programmes. This information is used to support UK government policy and co-ordinate UK aerospace technology strategy.

Current specific areas of interest are the integration of Remotely and Autonomously Piloted Systems into the existing airspace and understanding their potential to impact the nature of future airspace structures. Tool sets Transport & Business aircraft. Top level scoping tools: for conventional quick assessment of gross changes in Top Level Aircraft Requirements (TLAR). These are useful for generating very rapid aircraft assessments are required or where very little data is available. These Excel based tools are very much based on: i) single line methods for major component masses, field performance (take-off and approach); ii) input cruise L/D, optimum CL and SFC values plus CL Max for Take-Off and Approach; iii) a heavily modified Breguet range equation that includes the effects of lost range from climb and descent) effects and a reserve and contingency fuel calculation. A database of calibrated models for existing production aircraft provide a series of trends and staring points for new aircraft models. Pacelab APD More comprehensive whole aircraft analysis is performed with the Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) tool Pacelab APD/SysArc. This provides a complete set of conventional aircraft components, methods and reports. The methods are predominantly semi-empirical. Pacelab APD/SysArc was selected after considering it along with a number of the alternative options against a broad range of requirements linked to the ATI Whole Aircraft responsibilities and work scope plus its Graphical User Interface and interaction with other standard applications. In particular, it is an environment that provides an assured interface with the operating system (acceptable to ATI IT policy) as well as an intuitive user interface to manage 3D geometry, the data model as well as numerous standard output report structures and charts. Export of results to MS Office is very simple. Figure 2:Screen shot APD3.5 Engineering Workbench, including ATI with an A350-900 model The aircraft and performance analysis capability can be summarised as: i) Aerodynamics: full high speed and low drag polars are calculated based on geometry, design decisions and technology standards. These methods are generally at a conceptual level as the ATI does not have access to the necessary geometry to build a representative model or the resource to back-figure these characteristics with high fidelity tools; ii) Engine data: A full engine performance data set is used including SFC loops, all ratings, etc. This has been created using an ATI internal modelling capability from publicly available data (see below for more detailed description); iii) Engine Sizing: The whole engine cycle can be scaled to achieved the correct airframe/engine matching. The various ratings can be modified independently of each other and the fuel flow characteristics if required. iv) Mass estimates: these are based on principal influencing characteristics and technology standards. Again, these are generally semi-empirical methods as the ATI do not have access to the detail structural layout of the candidate aircraft; v) Performance uses first principles methods, i.e. the drag polar and engine data set are used to step through the defined mission profile and reserves.

Emergency department (ED) patients currently lack a sense of predictability about ED procedures. This increases frustration and aggression. Herein, we describe a system for providing real-time information to ED patients regarding the procedures in their ED medical journey. Objective This study aimed to develop a system that provides patients with dynamically updated information about the specific procedures and expected waiting times in their personal ED journey, and to report initial evaluations of this system. Methods To develop the myED system, we extracted information from hospital databases and translated it using process mining and user interface design into a language that is accessible and comprehensible to patients. We evaluated the system using a mixed methods approach that combined observations, interviews, and online records. Results Interviews with patients, accompanying family members, and health care providers (HCPs) confirmed patients\u2019 needs for information about their personal ED journey. The system developed enables patients to access this information on their personal mobile phones through a responsive website. In the third month after deployment, 492 of 1614 (30.48%) patients used myED. Patients\u2019 understanding of their ED journey improved significantly (F8,299=2.519; P=.01), and patients showed positive reactions to the system. We identified future challenges, including achieving quick engagement without delaying medical care. Salient reasons for poor system adoption were patients\u2019 medical state and technological illiteracy. HCPs confirmed the potential of myED and identified means that could improve patient experience and staff cooperation. Conclusions Our iterative work with ED patients, HCPs, and a multidisciplinary team of developers yielded a system that provides personal information to patients about their ED journey in a secure, effective, and user-friendly way. MyED communicates this information through mobile technology. This improves health care by addressing patients\u2019 psychological needs for information and understanding, which are often overlooked. We continue to test and refine the system and expect to find positive effects of myED on patients\u2019 ED experience and hospital operations.", "year": 2020}

The imbalanced skillsets among students in such classes may result in more experienced students not feeling adequately challenged, or less experienced students feeling pressured and experiencing a fast pace in class that makes it difficult to grasp a new topic before fully comprehending previous materials. We present a flexible, gamification-based approach that helps instructors create more customized learning environments, tailored to the students\u2019 needs. Gamification is defined as \u201cthe use of game design elements in non-game contexts\u201d (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, 2011). It has been used as an effective way to increase learning experience in areas such as industry, education, and health. Implementing such a tool happens naturally and unintrusively. Stronger students will feel more challenged on a voluntary basis while weaker students will have the flexibility to learn new materials at their own pace. In addition, this approach helps to sustain student engagement over the course of the semester. A competitive gaming platform is modeled with basic features to incentivize the fulfillment of both mandatory and voluntary assignments. It should be noted that the completed objectives are not the main grading criteria but can support overall grade in form of extra credits. The instructor ensures that the course content is adequately represented with mandatory assignments (level 1), however, throughout the semester students can unlock optional assignments based on personal choices (level 2 and 3). While assignments (level 1) are mandatory and count for most of the grade, students do have to complete a predetermined number of level 2 and level 3 assignments, however they can choose at will. Often such assignments offer in-depth learning experience of concepts already covered in level 1 assignments. Instead of affecting the grade, assignments may also provide other incentives, such as forgiveness cards for late submissions. Each completed assignment has a score attached. Students can view their progress against their class mates in an anonymized scoreboard. A personal map will be unlocked with each score increase and only a full score will reveal the entire map to students. An integrated leaderboard provides students with a subtle form of competitiveness that can improve learning effectiveness without adding pressure. The gamification tool can be fully integrated into popular LMSs, such as Canvas, minimizing instructor effort. Assignments can be managed on canvas while grading automatically updates the leaderboard and related data in the application. In this talk, we will explain our proposed solution accompanied by our preliminary design and user interface components. We implemented the system over the course of two semesters with great success and would like to share our experiences and the effect it had on the students\u2019 performance and motivation.", "year": 2018}

As part of this, a concerted effort is being made to optimally interface the crew-member to the technology in a way that will maximize overall effectiveness. The payoff for these efforts will be to have the crew do more than they have in the past, or have a reduced size crew perform at the same \u2013 or higher \u2013 level as the original crew would have. This study provides a framework process and techniques for crew augmentation with the end goal to reduce combat crew task load and increase overall crew performance. INTRODUCTION The Army\u2019s efforts toward the study and feasibility of reduced crew vehicle operations stretches back several decades. The argument of feasibility centers on the idea of crew member task load. Task load considerations are the leading concern when discussing reducing the crew size from current crew configurations. It is vital that a reduction in crew responsiveness and vehicle performance during combat operations, specifically during \u201chigh stress\u201d situations, does not occur. A reduction of these key aspects would offset any potential increase in capability the reduced crew concept may offer. The Army has recognized that in order for the reduced crewmember concept to work, technology must augment crewmembers to perform all traditional crew functions in order to compensate for the reduction of the crew. The US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) developed and integrated a fully functional two person crew-station to operate a modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle (traditionally operated by three persons). This paper describes the processes and techniques used to develop an effective two person crew-station, including Mission Engineering; Crew Augmentation & Design; and Development and Testing as shown in Figure 1. Previous Studies & Results Previous studies, such as those conducted by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), investigated reduced crew size in support of the Future Combat System (FCS). Utilizing an IMPRINT based model of crew tasks [1], ARL tested the ability of the crew to conduct crew operations with two versus three Proceedings of the 2018 Ground Vehicle Systems Engineering and Technology Symposium (GVSETS) Use of Crew Augmentation Techniques to Reduce Combat Crew Size DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. 2 crew members. The focus of the study was actual or vs perceived cognitive load on the crew, as it attempted to divide existing crew tasks across two rather than three crewmembers. The experiment concluded that without crew augmentation technologies the crew member performing two sets of tasks (separate and distinct) quickly became overloaded. Also, given the current task load required to operate the vehicle (M2 Bradley) in the stated test conditions; three vs two crewmembers would be more effective. The study did offer insight into possibly distributing the driver functions between commander and gunner functions, aided by automated scanning capability, could be the most functional. Another study, perhaps the most notable, was part of the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) Phase IIIB Experiment. The Maneuver Battle LAB (MBL) tested two person crew using Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) simulator designed to replicate a three crewmember M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV). In this virtual environment, the crews conducted offensive and defensive missions during major combat operations in a tactical scenario at the National Training Center (NTC). The study did provide some valuable suggestive insights to help alleviate command and control issues such as crew station redesign. Although the MBL study was the most comprehensive study prior to the MET-D Program, it fell short in several key areas. First, with respect to the AC3 construct (M2A3 Bradley with 2 person crew), the gunner, whom would normally be located in the turret, was removed from the crew station. The physical design of the M2A3 does not support this as it created both physical and functional challenges in crew operations (Figure 2). This concept placed most, if not all, of the responsibilities of the Gunner and the Vehicle Commander on a single crewmember who is also located in the turret. This arrangement, as discovered in the ARL FCS study, lead to a marked decrease in the effectiveness of the crew\u2019s ability to effectively communicate and coordinate during combat operations, especially during \u201chigh stress\u201d engagements. Both studies concluded that a two person crew station cannot function in the same physical space of a three person crew station, especially in existing combat vehicles. Also, an increase in technological capability that could augment the crew during all conditions during combat operations, such as autonomous engagement systems, autonomous driving, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence would reduce crew task load to more manageable levels. Additionally, the vehicles themselves will need to network at some level to pass targets and other mission critical information between systems in order to truly optimize platforms in the future operating environment. Finally, the experiment recognized that the current crew rank and experience level would need to be reexamined from the current BFV crew.

Initial operational analysis derived from current Army doctrinal individual/crew/collective tasks which were based on the Bradley platform in the form of Task & Evaluation Outlines (T&EO) from a Mission Essential Tasks List (METL). This method formulated the bases which standardized orders of operations at the individual and crew level which were then fully decomposed (Table 1). Three Vs. Two Person Crew Concept The Two Person Crew (2PC) concept derives from the M2 Bradley\u2019s three men crew individual and crew tasks. The current M2 Bradley crew consist of a Vehicle Commander (VC), Gunner (GNR), and Driver (DVR). Under the two person crew concept, the vehicle crew consist of two crewmembers, Crew Member 1 and Crew Member 2, both with user tailorable but identical crew stations capable of performing traditional vehicle commander, gunner, and driver functions simultaneously and independently \u2013 augmented by advanced technologies, specifically autonomous and artificial intelligent systems. Crew Member 1 (CM1) and Crew Member 2 (CM2) sit in close proximity. Through operational analysis, it was determine that \u201cside by side\u201d collocated crew stations are optimal on the basis of crew coordination, specifically during \u201chigh stress\u201d engagement scenarios. One crewmember is designated vehicle commander and therefore senior in ranking to the other. Both crewmembers would be highly trained in the concept, capable of operating the vehicle independent of the other crewmember. Driving Role \u2013 Ideally, while both Crew members would be capable of performing driving functions during all stages of vehicle operations, one crewmember has primary responsibility for driving functions at a given time. Transferring driving functionality from one crewmember to the other is seamless. Augmented by autonomous technology, this function\u2019s cognitive load is reduced in order to enhance crew operations during certain stages of operations. Gunner Role \u2013 Both Crew members are capable of performing traditional gunnery functions.

Particularly, the focus is on the scenario where a human applies a sequence of changing external forces through forceful operations (e.g. cutting a circular piece off a board) on an object that is grasped by a cooperative robot. We present a range of planners that 1) enable the robot to stabilize and position the object under the human applied forces by exploiting supports from both the object-robot and object-environment contacts; 2) improve task efficiency by minimizing the need of configuration and grasp changes required by the changing external forces; 3) improve human comfort during the forceful interaction by optimizing the defined comfort criteria. \n \nWe first focus on the instance of using only robotic grasps, where the robot is supposed to grasp/regrasp the object multiple times to keep it stable under the changing external forces. We introduce a planner that can generate an efficient manipulation plan by intelligently deciding when the robot should change its grasp on the object as the human applies the forces, and choosing subsequent grasps such that they minimize the number of regrasps required in the long-term. The planner searches for such an efficient plan by first finding a minimal sequence of grasp configurations that are able to keep the object stable under the changing forces, and then generating connecting trajectories to switch between the planned configurations, i.e. planning regrasps. We perform the search for such a grasp (configuration) sequence by sampling stable configurations for the external forces, building an operation graph using these stable configurations and then searching the operation graph to minimize the number of regrasps. We solve the problem of bimanual regrasp planning under the assumption of no support surface, enabling the robot to regrasp an object in the air by finding intermediate configurations at which both the bimanual and unimanual grasps can hold the object stable under gravity. We present a variety of experiments to show the performance of our planner, particularly in minimizing the number of regrasps for forceful manipulation tasks and planning stable regrasps. \n \nWe then explore the problem of using both the object-environment contacts and object-robot contacts, which enlarges the set of stable configurations and thus boosts the robot\u2019s capability in stabilizing the object under external forces. We present a planner that can intelligently exploit the environment\u2019s and robot\u2019s stabilization capabilities within a unified planning framework to search for a minimal number of stable contact configurations. A big computational bottleneck in this planner is due to the static stability analysis of a large number of candidate configurations. We introduce a containment relation between different contact configurations, to efficiently prune the stability checking process. We present a set of real-robot and simulated experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We present a detailed analysis of the proposed containment relationship, particularly in improving the planning efficiency. \n \nWe present a planning algorithm to further improve the cooperative robot behaviour concerning human comfort during the forceful human-robot interaction. Particularly, we are interested in empowering the robot with the capability of grasping and positioning the object not only to ensure the object stability against the human applied forces, but also to improve human experience and comfort during the interaction. We address human comfort as the muscular activation level required to apply a desired external force, together with the human spatial perception, i.e. the so-called peripersonal-space comfort during the interaction. We propose to maximize both comfort metrics to optimize the robot and object configuration such that the human can apply a forceful operation comfortably. We present a set of human-robot drilling and cutting experiments which verify the efficiency of the proposed metrics in improving the overall comfort and HRI experience, without compromising the force stability. \n \nIn addition to the above planning work, we present a conic formulation to approximate the distribution of a forceful operation in the wrench space with a polyhedral cone, which enables the planner to efficiently assess the stability of a system configuration even in the presence of force uncertainties that are inherent in the human applied forceful operations. We also develop a graphical user interface, which human users can easily use to specify various forceful tasks, i.e. sequences of forceful operations on selected objects, in an interactive manner. The user interface ties in human task specification, on-demand manipulation planning and robot-assisted fabrication together. We present a set of human-robot experiments using the interface demonstrating the feasibility of our system. \n \nIn short, in this thesis we present a series of planners for object manipulation under changing external forces. We show the object contacts with the robot and the environment enable the robot to manipulate an object under external forces, while making the most of the object contacts has the potential to eliminate redundant changes during manipulation, e.g. regrasp, and thus improve task efficiency and smoothness. We also show the necessity of optimizing human comfort in planning for forceful human-robot manipulation tasks. We believe the work presented here can be a key component in a human-robot collaboration framework.", "year": 2019}

Visuospatial performance was measured in a target orientation discrimination task, in terms of reaction time, and error rate. Approach. Our experiment extends the Posner paradigm by introducing a new type of ambiguous cues to indicate upcoming target location. The cues are designed so that their ambiguity is imperceptible to the user. This entails endogenous shifts of attention which are truly self-directed. Two protocols were implemented to exploit the decoding of attention shifts. The first \u2018adaptive\u2019 protocol uses the decoded locus to display the target. In the second \u2018warning\u2019 protocol, the target position is defined in advance, but a warning is flashed when the target mismatches the decoded locus. Main results. Both protocols were tested in an online experiment involving ten subjects. The reaction time improved in both the adaptive and the warning protocol. The error rate was improved in the adaptive protocol only. Significance. This proof of concept study brings evidence that visuospatial brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used to enhance improving human\u2013machine interaction in situations where humans must react to off-center events in the visual field.", "year": 2018}

With multiple stakeholders there exists an increased potential for debate, dissent, conflict, and miscommunication. Of particular note, the authors recognize the need for designers to follow a clear, concise, workable process to address the concerns of all stakeholders when working with indigenous knowledge on projects involving the graphical depiction of indigenous culture. This paper asserts the need for information and guidance to help designers be more aware of the context in which they are working, as it is a difficult landscape to navigate especially when identifying what is appropriate and what is appropriation.Three case study examples will be examined demonstrating the challenges surrounding concerns of identity creation and visual representation of indigenous communities in communication design. Revealing differing levels of engagement with stakeholders, the results of this research proposes designers need to embed procedures of stakeholder engagement in design practice to work appropriately and ethically with indigenous knowledge. Introducing this as a new concept to assist designers with their awareness of the context in which they are working, this paper identifies the ladder of stakeholder engagement as an internationally relevant, solid foundation upon which to create an understanding of suitable processes and procedures to better consider the concerns of the client, consumer, designer, and community.McCoy states: \"As professional designers, we have developed an effective body of theory, method, and form to deal with both the sender and message. Now we must do the same for the receiver component of the communications equation\" (2006, p.203). In earlier research, Buchanan took a similar position when he explained that despite the impact of massproduction, the solution is to no longer design for a universal audience, or national groups, or even large market segments; \"the task is to design for the individual placed in his or her immediate context\" (1998, p.20). In agreement to McCoy's comments, Marcus (2004) discusses digital environments and the impact of cultural differences in the ways people engage with graphical layouts. Marcus argues that cross-cultural user-interface designers need to account for dimensions of cultures when they consider potential design strategies and adapt these to the needs of different locales. He points out that there may be cultural biases in traditional industry usability precepts and that deep cultural influences affect the way people think, act, and feel. The symbolic design object selected triggers cultural associations and hence the need to address the symbolic issues of culturally driven representation.These comments highlight the necessity for visual communication to remain personal in its communication strategies. However, when designing in a cross cultural context where the communication must work with a range of culturally diverse audiences and a broad range of stakeholders, it is difficult to appeal to the multiple recipients who hold a strong emotional investment in the message being sent. In this situation, the stakeholder base expands and the varying levels of appeal increase exponentially. Adding another level of complexity to the discussion is when the design is a graphical depiction of indigenous culture. It does not imply that designers need to have an expanded knowledge of all cultures or indigenous culture, nor does it claim to explain what is appropriate or inappropriate. It does however assert the need for designers to seek information on a case-by case basis and to understand respectful methods of engagement. Designers should not feel a need to avoid the issue; they simply need to start relevant projects with a blank canvas, listen, not make assumptions, and embark on the process without preconceived ideas. \u2026", "year": 2016}

Specifically, this study identified the knowledge and benefits of using LMS as perceived by students studying education programs. This study involved 40 education students studying at various levels of education programs in one higher education institution and employed questionnaires to collect data. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The study found that students have a good knowledge on LMS and a positive view on LMS. The study suggested that LMS facilitate postgraduate students in their learning process and thus should be designed to provide a user friendly interface and navigation to support students\u2019 learning. Keyword: Learning Management System (LMS), Online Learning & Teaching and Learning. Introduction A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. The learning management system concept emerged directly from e-Learning. Although the first LMS appeared in the higher education sector, the majority of the LMS today focus on the corporate market. Learning Management Systems make up the largest segment of the learning system market. The first introduction of the LMS was in the late 1990s. Learning management systems were designed to identify training and learning gaps, utilizing analytical data and reporting. LMS are focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous based and synchronous based. An LMS may offer classroom management for instructor-led training or a flipped classroom, used in higher education, but not in the corporate space. Literature Review 'E-learning' was an effective platform in providing opportunities for students as well as to communicate more openly without boundaries (Susanti & Sholeh, 2008). One of the reasons is elearning used learning management system, i.e. an application software that assists the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses, training program or learning and development programme. According to Adobe (2009), Nasser, Cherif, & Romanowski (2011), Islam (2016), 'e-learning' is a learning activity organized by electronic and computer systems in order to make sure the learning process can be easily conducted. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 11, November, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 \u00a9 2019 HRMARS 1531 Malaysia is moving towards a developed country and promotes e \u2013 learning as one of the ways to empower its citizenship. In the 10th Malaysia Plan, the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (2011) proposed the National 'e-learning' Policy of Higher Education Institutions to advance the use of technology in education. Following the policy, the government had rebuilt an online learning system or better known as 'e-learning' that enables students to manage their learning activities and personalized their learning content, as well as facilitates student-teacher interaction and provides a variation of student assessment tools (Kassim & Khalid, 2016; Komsoon, 2019). The learning system also provides subject information, lecture notes and links to various sources of information (Harris & Aziz, 2016). However, the learning system still have a gap for improvement. According to a recent study by Abidin & Razak (2015), one of the main concerns raised by educators is the issue of limited current storage space which affects the educator to manage their work space as well as to complicate the teaching process. Furthermore, the regulatory issue still need to be improved as the provision of support assistance and friendly system that can help the users to understand better (Idris & Ahmad, 2011). Research Objective This study aimed was to identify the level of knowledge of LMS and trend of LMS usage among education students. This study also aimed to examine the benefits of LMS as perceived by the students. Research Method This study employed survey research design and involved 40 education students in one of research universities in Malaysia. The samples were randomly selected among students in the faculty of education within the university. The study employed questionnaires to collect data which were developed online using the google form and later distributed via whatsapp and telegram applications. Data was recorded and analyzed using SPSS program in which descriptive statistics were used to describe and present the data. Results As illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, most of the respondents are female (60%) and undergraduate students (62.5%). Table 1 illustrated that students from education programs have a good knowledge regarding LMS and use LMS extensively as teaching and learning process using LMS is widely practiced in the their learning institution. The used of LMS reduces the need for students and lecturers to meet face to face, as well as helps students to learn at their own pace and time.

Findings of the study suggested that LMS offers students with a variety of learning tools that help courses to become more effective. The findings also indicated that LMS is a great tool for students\u2019 learning as the system ables to streamline learning by leveraging the benefits of the Internet without neglecting the importance of a teaching staff (Azfar, 2016; Nordin et.al, 2017). LMS assists also helps lecturers to manage students and courses offered in every semester assists lecturers to assess students\u2019 learning in various learning stages using various forms of assessment ( Mat, Alias & Muslim, 2017) The positive view of students with regard to the use of LMS found in the study might be due to advantages of LMS that enables students to engage in learning anywhere and anytime. Such engagement could help students to think and act independently in the pursuit of knowledge, and in return increase students\u2019 learning. Futhermore, LMS is able to centralize learning and teaching strategies to better organize and deliver learning to students anytime and anywhere. According to Farhan (2011), all information on courses and training programs could be combined into one system, i.e. LMS. The system enables students to communicate actively with their lecturers and friends virtually, and by doing so assists students to learn from their lecturers and peers. However, to support such active learning, there is a need for LMS to be more user friendly and have a larger storage data capacity (Klein et al., 2019; Hutchison, 2019). International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 11, November, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 \u00a9 2019 HRMARS 1534 Conclusion Dated back to early 1900s, LMS focused on administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of courses and training programs. Featuring similar facilities, modern LMS is cloud-based and accessible anytime, anywhere. Best of all, modern LMS complies with latest educational requirement of the digital age. Not only LMS offers learning content to students, the system provides ways to personalize learning to all types of learners in the digital age such as school, college and university students, adult learners, scholars, and corporate trainees. Technology assisted learning is the way forward to support the 21st century learning. The application LMS in any formal or non-formal education setting would be a good example to support learning in the 21st century. The findings indicated that higher education students have excellent knowledge of LMS and acknowledge the benefits of LMS in their learning process. The study implicated that there is a need for higher education institutions to provide students with a user friendly and larger storage data capacity LMS that would facilitate active and cooperative learning among students regardless of time and place. The findings also suggested further study to identify the effectiveness of LMS usage in students\u2019 learning in comparison to conventional ways of learning as well as identify best principles for developing LMS interface for active and collaborative learning.

They provide rich and objective product information that is influencing customers\u2019 decision making (Gu, Tang and Whinston 2013, Kim and Gupta 2009, Zacharia, Moukas and Maes 2000), due to the credibility, empathy and relevance they offer to customers as opposed to the information provided by marketer-designed websites (Bickart and Schindler 2001). Through eWOM, users can freely post their reviews about any product or service, and share those reviews with other users in order to better understand a product (Hennig-Thurau, et al. 2004). Thus, through eWOM communities, a great audience of users is able to acquire knowledge from reviews concerning products and services that are less popular to the majority. In that respect, the distribution of product sales is changing due to the increment of product information available to consumers (Brynjolfsson, Hu, & Smith, 2010) facilitating the long tail phenomenon (Anderson 2004). Many authors have given a good understanding of the main idea behind long tail within sales distributions in product markets such as Amazon (Brynjolfsson, Hu, & Smith, 2003; Brynjolfsson, Hu, & Smith, 2010). However, this Thesis goes beyond and applies new methodologies \u2013elbow criterion\u2013 and extends others \u2013power-law distribution\u2013 by Clauset, Shalizi and Newman (2009) to mathematically measure the long tail in other environments, such as the eWOM community Ciao. Whereas most eWOM studies focus just on the potential of eWOM facilitating the long tail effect to find rare or niche products (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh, & Gremler, 2004; Khammash & Griffiths, 2011) and how eWOM is enabling zero-cost dissemination of information about products (Odic, Tkalcic, Tasic, & Kosir, 2013) and so forth, not many noticed that for each product type enclosed in the tail of the sales distribution there might be different impacts. In this regard, the results within this Thesis might indicate that vendors could adopt alternative product strategies depending on with which niche product type (search or experience good) the tails of sales distribution would be formed. More specifically, this Thesis proposes an approach for detecting whether there is a long tail for each product type and thus, cases should be differentiated when niche products represent a significant portion of overall product sales. Likewise, given the volume of the user-generated content in the web and its speed of change this Thesis also presents two important highlights in this regard. First, the implementation of an effective web crawler that can gather and identify big amounts of user-generated content. Second, the stages followed on this crawling process, which are the identification and collection of important data, and the maintenance of the gathered data. Consequently, social science needs to develop adequate methodologies to deal with huge amounts of data, such as the one outlined within this Thesis and overcome the distance between technology and social sciences. The chosen methodology within this Thesis has been to triangulate the method of power-law distribution of data gathered with other method, the elbow criterion in order to identify the long tail. That is, to compare the all the type of products among the eWOM Ciao UK, the probability power-law distribution function was represented as a tool to measure the long tail. Besides, to extra validate such method the elbow criterion was also used to identify where was located the optimal cut-off point that distinguishes the products characterized by the long tail. Furthermore, this Thesis outlines an architectural framework and methodology to gather user-generated data the eWOM community Ciao UK. To that end, a new methodology describes the implementation of a web crawler from other disciplinary perspective: the computing science discipline. Interestingly, the present thesis aims to contribute to the study of the long tail phenomenon in an eWOM community and what product types are enclosed there. To this end the three following hypotheses where contrasted: H1: The experience products from the distribution of product categories within an eWOM are more likely to exhibit a long tail. H2: The search products from the distribution of product categories within an eWOM are less likely to exhibit a long tail. H3: The distribution of product categories within an eWOM that have high frequency events or super-hits in the short head are not particularly associated with search or experience products. The results supported all the three proposed hypotheses. In this sense, this Thesis presents important new findings. Firstly, it is evidenced that products having a long tail are those with subjective evaluation standards, which are classified as experience products. Secondly, it is also corroborated that search products, which have a high level of objective attributes in the total product assessment do not encourage the long tail phenomenon. Thirdly, there is a combination of products when there are super-hits in the short head of the distribution. Thus, those are not particularly associated with search or experience products since they contain either objective or subjective evaluation standards. Finally, it is also remarkable to highlight that not all the categories fitting a power-law distribution are characterized by a long tail and on the contrary, some of those having a long tail do not fit a power-law. In general, the findings also suggest the potentials of eWOM, which, in general, might generate a long tail effect, where a large number of small-volume vendors coexist with a few high-volume ones. Furthermore, this Thesis has contributed to both theory and practice, essentially, in three different ways: (1) with a methodology of collection of online user-generated data in the context of social sciences; (2) with the development of two more accurate methods to identify niche products within an eWOM community, providing a deeper understanding of the long tail phenomena and the type of products; and (3) with publications of refereed journals papers (indexed in JCR/JSCR) as well as conference papers related to the main topic of this Thesis.", "year": 2017}

Abstract:</b> As recently commercial virtual reality (VR) devices has been released, it is expected that related VR market size would dramatically increase. However, VR interaction interfaces that allow users to navigate virtual environment are limited. VR omnidirectional treadmills are under development, but they are mostly cumbersome, expensive, and limit users\u2019 movement. Therefore, walking-in-place (WIP) based system has gained attention as relatively simple and cheap way. Most of current WIP based systems use wearable inertial sensors that shows limitations of discomfort at long-time use, noise at intensive movement, and limited choice of possible interactions. In this study we aim to overcome limitations of current systems by developing a multiple kinect based portable omnidirectional navigation system for immersive virtual reality. The method to achieve stable omnidirectional skeleton (joint position) data by integrating data from the multiple Kinects will be investigated, and core algorithms to detect the gait cycle of WIP to properly control walking speed and direction of the VR avatar will be developed. The developed system then will be further validated through the usability test for major gait interactions including for/side/backward walking and running based on various VR application scenarios in a constructed simulated virtual environment.<br><br>One critical problem in terms of the accuracy of multiple Kinect tracking was found during the research process, and we have determined to use single Kinect instead which is superior in terms of both tracking accuracy and effectiveness. Research objective was changed to Semi-omnidirectional navigation accordingly, considering limitation of the single Kinect. For WIP detection, criteria for classifying each of for/side/backward WIP motion were established based on characteristics of positional relationship between joints investigated from the motional analysis of WIP cycle. After calibrating position data based on the user\u2019s view angle for smooth detection, classification criteria was applied on the calibrated position data in order to identify the type of WIP motion among for/side/backward WIP. Then detection of the WIP motion was occurred based on continuous movement of ankle joint position that shows relatively high accuracy at any direction. Detection was segmented with small threshold value to reflect size and frequency of the WIP motion, to smoothen increase and decrease of the walking speed, and to minimize detection delay at start and end of the movement.<br><br>Evaluation of usability and user experience of the system prototype showed that it has acceptable usablity with the SUS score of 78.3 and positive user experience according to the UEQ-S result. In addition, participants felt overall system experience was immersive and felt like they actually became an avatar that exists inside the virtual space, but they also felt sideward WIP did not represent the actual sideward walking well and felt unnaturalistic. The interview with participants revealed some problems of the current system, and corresponding improvements were figured out. This research established theoretical framework of single Kinect and WIP based semi-omnidirectional VR navigation, and suggested side/backward WIP for the first time. The developed algorithms may serve as an useful input for researchers and practitioners in the related field. The developed system can be applied in numerous VR applications that need navigation inside virtual space. It is expected that the new VR contents business based on the suggested new way of VR interaction can be facilitated. For future research, the system can be further improved based on participants\u2019 feedback collected from usability evaluation. Moreover, it is necessary to implement more stable WIP detection in wider range, and verify effectiveness of the system with larger number of participants.", "year": 2018}

According to the summary report of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC) in July 2016, the Internet use rate in Taiwan was up to 84.8%, whereas the VC use rate was up to 64.4%, thereby implying that VC gained the attention of Internet users. By contrast, the growth rate of VC from 2015 to 2016 increased 30%, thus indicating a promising business opportunity. Participation in a VC is related to the delivery of a variety of services to users within all sectors, to computer-supported collaborative tasks within information services, and to both informal and formal activities for professional updating, learning, and development (Levy, 1997). Pai and Tsai (2011) found that VC participation significantly enhances consumer loyalty intentions. Accordingly, applying VC in communication with online customers can be a significant approach for strategy planning. A cosmetic-related VC is often provided on a cosmetic-related website, such as a customer forum. For example, UrCosme (https://wwwurcosme.com), the first cosmetic-related portal site in Taiwan, allows cosmetic users to share their experiences in cosmetic product use. Currently, 103,700 articles of usage experience and 74,465 cosmetic product data are accumulated in its database, and 442,257 members have registered. UrCosme provides rich information about cosmetics and beauty care, which members can browse through before shopping. When buying cosmetic products, most consumers search for related information on the Internet, such as blogs and cosmetic-related websites, before making a decision (Insightxplorer, 2013). Compared with TV and magazines, cosmetic websites affect consumer purchase intentions the most, and after searching for cosmetic information online, more than 40% people would like to purchase afterward (Insightxplorer, 2013). Therefore, we consider that understanding the determinants of re-usage intention related to this kind of VC is important for encouraging customers who continuously wander in a cosmetic-related VC. Industries that want to apply VC as a marketing tool to perform marketing activities can then have a specific guideline for strategic planning. Many theoretical models, such as the technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of reasoned action (TRA), and theory of planned behavior (TPB), have been applied to examine human behavioral intentions. Davis (1989) indicated that these models could successfully predict the acceptance of an innovation at about 40%. Superior to these models is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT), a technology innovation acceptance model that can account for an impressive 70% of the variance in behavioral intention and 50% of actual usage (Venkatesh, Thong, & Xu, 2012). Thus, the authors of this study were motivated to use UTAUT as the theoretical framework to conduct an empirical study using cosmetic-related VC (an IT-based and self-supported business application) as the research context. The specific purposes of this study were: (1) to understand whether or not UTAUT can provide a solid theoretical basis for examining VC re-usage in cosmetics web business; (2) to investigate the factors affecting VC members' VC re-use intentions; and (3) to determine the potential moderating effects of demographic variables. Answers to these questions can assist industries to solve business promotion problems and to design a more effective online marketing strategy. The remainder of this paper presents first the relevant studies on VC, the UTAUT model, and an overview of cosmetic products sales in the Literature Review section. In the Methodology section, we present the research method including our research model, development of the hypotheses, questionnaire design, and data-collecting process. We discuss in detail the analysis results in the Analysis and Result section. \u2026", "year": 2017}

At NASA, a number of groups have explored the possibilities afforded by AR and VR technology, among which is the IT Advanced Concepts Lab (ITACL). Within ITACL, the AVR (Augmented/Virtual Reality) Lab focuses on VR technology specifically for its use in command and control. Previous work in the AVR lab includes the Natural User Interface (NUI) project and the Virtual Control Panel (VCP) project, which created virtual three-dimensional interfaces that users could interact with while wearing a VR headset thanks to body- and hand-tracking technology. The Virtual Tablet (VT) project attempts to improve on these previous efforts by incorporating a physical surrogate which is mirrored in the virtual environment, mitigating issues with difficulty of visually determining the interface location and lack of tactile feedback discovered in the development of previous efforts. The physical surrogate takes the form of a handheld sheet of acrylic glass with several infrared-range reflective markers and a sensor package attached. Using the sensor package to track orientation and a motion-capture system to track the marker positions, a model of the surrogate is placed in the virtual environment at a position which corresponds with the real-world location relative to the user's VR Head Mounted Display (HMD). A set of control mechanisms is then projected onto the surface of the surrogate such that to the user, immersed in VR, the control interface appears to be attached to the object they are holding. The VT project was taken from an early stage where the sensor package, motion-capture system, and physical surrogate had been constructed or tested individually but not yet combined or incorporated into the virtual environment. My contribution was to combine the pieces of hardware, write software to incorporate each piece of position or orientation data into a coherent description of the object's location in space, place the virtual analogue accordingly, and project the control interface onto it, resulting in a functioning object which has both a physical and a virtual presence. Additionally, the virtual environment was enhanced with two live video feeds from cameras mounted on the robotic device being used as an example target of the virtual interface. The working VT allows users to naturally interact with a control interface with little to no training and without the issues found in previous efforts.", "year": 2016}

In the realm of career decision-making, technology has made the conversion of standardized career assessments such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and career interest inventories into online versions for instant scoring and results. These types of assessments can provide insight and potential career matches, but not everyone fits neatly into the established categories nor does everyone find their career fit through such assessments. In fact, connecting a personality type to an occupation has not proven to result in job satisfaction or high job performance (Arnold, 2004). Often, additional work is needed to bring one's personality, passion, preferences, values, and life situation together to design a career path that is fulfilling and financially gratifying. This is where career coaches, counselors, and other professionals often come in to play, to help the job seeker pull the pieces together and decide which career opportunities to pursue.The career development field, like the rest of the world, has experienced times of rapid transition during major shifts in the global job market and economy (Lent, 2001) and has been unable to address the seemingly chronic condition of a lack of employee engagement in the workplace (Gallup, n.d.). The reasons for low engagement and job satisfaction are complex and intertwined and the career development field requires approaches that can address this complexity. Helping job seekers to see patterns, new perspectives, and their strengths is important to identify a good career fit, but this process is not an easy one for many job seekers. Zikic and Hall (2009) described different types of barriers to career exploration and decision-making, including socioeconomic, situational, personal, emotional, and relational factors.Often, the career-making process is daunting and confusing, even more so for the individuals who don't have the resources to work with a career professional. It is important for the field to take stock of the resources we have to address the complexities of career decision-making for underserved and indecisive individuals. Technology has given the field robust tools to research jobs, connect with like-minded individuals, keep track of actions, and assess personality traits but not much to motivate a wide audience to do the difficult work of self-exploration and moving out of comfort zones.GamificationHowever, there is a concept that is used in businesses, schools, and human resources that has yet to be utilized by the career guidance field: gamification. Gamification does not refer to games, per se, but rather game-like elements in non-gaming situations. For example, businesses provide points and rewards to repeat customers, sales teams use leader boards to encourage competition and higher revenue generation, and HR departments create simulations of the work experience to entice recruits (Meister, 2015). More complex gaming elements include story-telling, problemsolving, feedback, and customized challenges. A primary purpose of gamification is user- customer, employee, student-engagement. The methods are intended to both introduce fun into task-oriented processes and trigger the body's natural reward mechanisms (Hartley, 2013).Gamification is not a new concept. How often have parents or teachers turned a tedious task into a game, introduced prizes, or tapped into an innate desire to play? In fact, the current process of gamification is well-established in the classroom (Faiella & Ricciardi, 2015), but has expanded beyond school into the adult-centered world of work (Marczewski, 2012). The ubiquity of computer-based games and advances in neuropsychology have prompted both researchers and businesses to investigate the potential upsides-and market potential-of games' addictive qualities when used in other contexts. \u2026", "year": 2016}

{"paperId": "ef4661bd3f916130e2b258d0f79f97d1330e6600", "title": "Anomaly Detection in Clouds: Challenges and Practice", "abstract": "Cloud computing is an important infrastructure for many enterprises. After 10 years of development, cloud computing has achieved a great success, and has greatly changed the economy, society, science and industries. In particular, with the rapid development of mobile Internet and big data technology, almost all of the online services and data services are built on the top of cloud computing, such as the online banking services provided by banks, the electronic services provided by the news media, the government cloud information systems provided by the government departments, the mobile services provided by the communications companies. Besides, tens of thousands of Start-ups rely on the provision of cloud computing services. Therefore, ensuring cloud reliability is very important and essential. However, the reality is that the current cloud systems are not reliable enough. On February 28th 2017, Amazon Web Services, the popular storage and hosting platform used by a huge range of companies, experienced S3 service interruption for 4 hours in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) Region, and then quickly spread other online service providers who rely on the S3 service [2]. This failure caused a huge economic loss. It is because cloud computing service providers typically set a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with customers. For example, when customers require 99.99% availability, it means that 99.99% of the time must meet the requirement for 365 days per year. If the service breaks more than 0.01%, compensation is required. In fact, with the continuous development and maturity of cloud computing, a large number of traditional business systems have been deployed on the cloud platform. Cloud computing integrates existing hardware resources through virtualization technology to create a shared resource pool that enables applications to obtain computing, storage, and network resources on demand, effectively enhancing the scalability and resource utilization of traditional IT infrastructures and significantly reducing the operation cost of the traditional business systems. However, with the growing number of applications running on the cloud, the scale of cloud data center has been expanding, the current cloud computing system has become very complex, mainly reflected in: 1) Large scale. A typical data center involves more than 100,000 servers and 10,000 switches, more nodes usually mean higher probability of failure; 2) Complex application structure. Web search, e-commerce and other typical cloud program has a complex interactive behavior. For example, an Amazon page request involves interaction with hundreds of components [7], error in any one component will lead to the whole application anomalies; 3) Shared resource pattern. One of the basic features of cloud computing is resource sharing, a typical server in Google Cloud data center hosts 5 to 18 applications simultaneously, each server runs about 10.69 applications [5]. Resource competition will interfere with each other and affect application performance. The complexity of these cloud computing systems, the complexity of application interaction structure and the inherent sharing pattern of cloud platforms make cloud systems more prone to performance anomalies than traditional platforms. It can be said that anomaly is a normal state in cloud computing [3]. For further analysis, resource competition, resource bottlenecks, misconfiguration, software defects, hardware failures, and external attacks can cause cloud system anomalies or failures. Performance anomaly refers to any sudden degradation of performance that deviates from the normal behavior of the system. Unlike outages that cause the system to stop running immediately, performance anomalies typically result in a decrease in system efficiency. The reasons such as misconfiguration, software defects, hardware failures, can often cause performance anomalies. For cloud computing systems, it is not enough to detect outages or other functional anomalies, because those anomalies often cause service interruption and can be resolved by simply restarting or replacing hardware. While performance anomalies caused by resource sharing and interference are more worthy of attention [4], because the performance anomalies can be eliminated before service interruption to ensure continued services. If the performance anomalies of cloud computing system are not timely handled, it may cause very serious consequences, which not only affect the business system to run normally, but also hinder the enterprise to deploy their services on cloud systems. Especially for the those latency-sensitive cloud applications, it is extremely important to eliminate performance anomalies in a timely manner. For example, Amazon found a 1% decline in sales per 100ms latency, Google found a 20% drop in traffic for every 0.5s latency in search page, and stock traders found that it would cause a loss of 400 Million dollars if their electronic trading platform lagged behind the competitors by 5 ms. Other research also shows that the average maximum time of cloud data center failure is about 100 hours, which seriously affects the experience of cloud service users. In the cloud environment, as a large number of business systems are deployed in the cloud data center, cloud data center failure will affect a large number of users, such as the previously mentioned Amazon S3 failure, resulting in serious economic losses. Thus, timely and accurate detection of the cloud computing anomalies is very important. Anomaly detection is an effective means to help cloud platform administrators monitor and analyze cloud behaviors and improve cloud reliability. It helps to identify unusual behavior of the system so that cloud platform administrators can take proactive operations before a system crash or service failure. However, due to the characteristics such as large-scale, complex and resource sharing, it is very difficult to accurately detect anomalies in cloud computing. If the anomalies can not be accurately detected, the further recovery will be out of the question. Due to the importance of the problem, current mainstream cloud computing service providers usually provide online monitoring services. Amazon developed CloudWatch [1] for its EC2 users to monitor virtual machine instance status, resource usage, network traffic, disk read and write status, etc. Google developed Dapper framework [6] to provide state monitoring for Google search engines. But those monitoring services only provide simple data presentation, lack of in-depth analysis of monitoring data (such as cross-level correlation analysis), and is not intelligent enough for anomaly reasoning (such as cross-node fault source localization). In cloud data center, as the size of detected objects is very large and interrelated, the object being detected itself is in a high dynamic environment, it is very challenging to detect anomalies in an accurate, real-time and adaptive way. The existing anomaly detection solution lacks effective discovery and reasoning of the anomaly, which leads to the inability to locate and eliminate the anomaly in time. This is also the main reason that causes the current cloud platform accident frequently. In this talk, we introduce our solution for anomaly detection in clouds. 1) Anomaly detection. In order to efficiently detect the potential anomalies, we perform large-scale offline performance testing and also create an online detection method. i) Offline testing. The purpose is to find the key performance bottleneck and quantify comparison between difference hardware and software. We first propose a three-layer benchmarking methodology to fully evaluates cloud performance and then present a new benchmark suite -- Virt-B [11] -- that measures various scenarios, such as single machine virtualization, server consolidation, VM mapping, VM live migration, HPC virtual clusters and Hadoop virtual cluster. Finally, we introduce a performance testing toolkit to automate the benchmarking process. ii) Online detection. The purpose is to monitor applications in real time and quickly detect potential faults. We propose a quantile regression based online anomaly detection method and did a case study on 67 real Yahoo! anomaly traffic datasets. 2) Anomaly inference. We propose a dependency graph based anomaly inference method. Dependency reflects interaction relationship and execution path, and can be used for fault localization. There are usually three methods that can be used to fetch the dependency graph: instrumentation, extract configuration files and analyze network traffic. We create light-weight agents to monitor the traffic and use sampling technique to reduce the overheads. The advantages of our solution include: supports VMs (Xen/KVM), accuracy guarantee based on probability theory, dynamic dependency construction, focuses on the PM/VM layer, and low overheads. 3) Anomaly recovery. The traditional recovery methods like Checkpoint/Restart has high overheads and are not suitable for latency-sensitive applications. While we propose two solutions: cache-aware fault VM isolation and migration-based fault recovery. i) Cash-Aware Fault Isolation [8].

A power tilt-in-space wheelchair (allowing simultaneous pivoting of the seat and the backrest of the wheelchair toward the back or front) meets many clinical purposes, including pressure management, increased postural control, and pain management. However, there is a significant gap between the use of tilt as recommended by clinicians and its actual usage. A Web-based electronic health (eHealth) intervention, including a goal setting, monitoring, reminder, and feedback system of the use of power tilt-in-space wheelchairs was developed. The intervention incorporates behavior change principles to promote optimal use of tilt and to improve clinical postprocurement follow-up. Objective This study aimed to conduct a formative evaluation of the intervention prototype to pinpoint the functionalities needed by end users, namely, power wheelchair users and clinicians. Methods On the basis of an evaluation framework for Web-based eHealth interventions, semistructured interviews were conducted with power wheelchair users and clinicians. A content analysis was performed with a mix of emerging and a priori concepts. Results A total of 5 users of power tilt-in-space wheelchairs and 5 clinicians who had experience in the field of mobility aids aged 23 to 55 years were recruited. Participants found the Web interface and the physical components easy to use. They also appreciated the reminder feature that encourages the use of the tilt-in-space and the customization of performance goals. Participants requested improvements to the visual design and learnability of the Web interface, the customization of reminders, feedback about specific tilt parameters, and the bidirectionality of the interaction between the user and the clinician. They thought the current version of the intervention prototype could promote optimal use of the tilt and improve clinical postprocurement follow-up. Conclusions On the basis of the needs identified by power wheelchair users and clinicians regarding the prototype of a power tilt-in-space wheelchair monitoring system, 3 main directions were defined for future development of the intervention. Further research with new wheelchair users, manual tilt-in-space wheelchairs, various age groups, and family caregivers is recommended to continue the formative evaluation of the prototype.", "year": 2019}

Data were collected from 400 customers based on quota sampling technique to cover the Egyptian population distribution and analyzed by using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). FindingsThe results of our paper showed that firm-created social media brand communication has a significant positive direct impact on only four CBBE dimensions (brand awareness, brand perceived quality, brand associations and brand trust). Whereas user-generated social media brand communication has no significant impact on brand perceived quality, brand loyalty, and brand trust. Additionally, it has been found that user-generated social media brand communication has a negative impact on brand awareness and brand associations. Originality/value \u2013 This paper adds to the body of knowledge by focusing on the impact of two different types of social media communication (firm-created and user-generated social media brand communication) on 5 CBBE dimensions (brand awareness, brand perceived quality, brand associations, brand loyalty, and brand trust) in new context, which is the Egyptian FMCG industry. On the other hand, this paper provides vital information to the marketing specialists and brand managers to understand how CBBE dimensions could be built via two different types of social media communication. 1-Introduction Social media have evolved as new technological tools, which use mobile and web-based technologies to generate very interactive and collaborative platforms through which individuals and societies share, discuss, and amend user-generated content (Kietzmann et al. 2011). Social media include diverse outlets such as: social networking sites (SNS), creativity works sharing sites, business networking sites, collaborative websites, etc. (Mangold & Faulds 2009). In latest years, SNS have grown rapidly and have become the main media through which people develop their personal network online (Schivinski & Dabrowski 2015). The rapid growth of SNS is not only among individuals and societies but also amongst companies (Schivinski & Dabrowski 2015). Companies are using SNS to promote and communicate information about their brands (Kaplan & Haenlein 2012). With the number of people accessing the Internet exceeding 49 percent of the world\u2019s population (Internet World Stats 2017), 1.86 billion active users accessing the SNS particularly Facebook (Internet World Stats 2017) and 32 million active users accessing the Facebook in Egypt (Internet World Stats 2017), social media can be used as a strong communication channel for brands that seek to connect with their customers to enhance their brand equity (Khalid 2016). Social media has helped in creating a The Business and Management Review, Volume 8 Number 5 May 2017 International Conference on Business & Entrepreneurship, Supply Chain Management & Information Systems, Alexandria, Egypt, 238 major change in the traditional marketing communication tools(Bruhn, Schoenmueller & Schafer 2012). The traditional one-way communication is now multi-dimensional, two-way and peer-to-peer communication (Berthon et al. 2008). It is really important that we differentiate between the two types of social media communication as one is controlled by the firm, whereas the other is independent of the company\u2019s control(Schivinski & Dabrowski 2015). Despite, the fast growth in popularity of social media across consumers and companies, few studies focused on the impact of these two types of social media brand communication on two or maximum three CBBE dimensions (such as: Bruhn, Schoenmueller & Schafer 2012; Schivinski & Dabrowski 2015). Besides, these previous studies were conducted in European context and in different industries like clothing and mobile network providers. Based on Schivinski and Dabrowski (2015), there is a need to further examine the impact of these types of social media in other countries and also in other industries. Therefore, this paper provides a better understanding by filling the gaps found in the previous studies through answering the following research question: How do firm-created and user-generated social media brand communication impact 5 CBBE dimensions in the Egyptian FMCG via the most popular SNS in Egypt-Facebook. Consequently, we developed a conceptual framework to examine the impact of firm-created and user-generated social media brand communication on brand awareness, brand perceived quality, brand associations, brand loyalty and brand trust on the Egyptian FMCG industry.In Egypt, the household FMCG expenditure is ranked second with value of (US$27.6bn) which represents almost 34.4% from the family income (KPMG Africa report 2016, Capmas 2017). 2. Literature review 2.1Social Media and Facebook Social media is becoming an integral part of everyday life for communicating, sharing information and content (Khalid 2016). Social media has brought revolutionary new ways of interacting, participating, cooperating and collaborating (Bruhn, Schoenmueller & Schafer 2012). It involves users generating content and connecting with people through a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d, rather than the traditional \u201cone-to-many\u201d, communication approach (Prahalad & Ramaswamy 2004). Among social media platforms, Facebook is the most widely used (Arenas-Gaitan et al. 2013) and it is considered the most popular SNS (Lipsman et al. 2012). In 2017,the population of Facebook exceeded the population of China making it the largest \u201cvirtual\u201d country in the world (Schwab2017). Egypt is considered a regional leader in MENA in the number of Facebook users covering 26.4% of the total number of users in the region (E-marketing Egypt platform 2016). Nevertheless, SNS particularly Facebook is not only used among customers but also it can provide businesses with a relatively quick and low cost method of connecting with customers (Fischer & Reuber 2011). Traditionally, marketers viewed value as something created within the firm and then offered to customers who decide their willingness to pay(Vargo & Lusch 2004). However, value creation is now becoming a process of co-creation involving both firm and customer through an ongoing dialogue of experiences and transparent communications (Saarij\u00e4rvi, H., Kannan, P.K. & Kuusela, H2013). 2.2 Firm Created and User generated social media brand communication For the past few years, social network services (SNS) have become very popular for millions of users, becoming their daily practices (Boyd & Ellison 2007).According to Shi et al. 2010 this wide spread and increasing influence on society increased the commercial value of SNS. As a result, a firm\u2019s SNS page became an essential part of its business as an essential tool for many service functions toward customers (Schivinski & Dabrowski 2015). There are many benefits that a firm can achieve through its SNS page such as (1) an additional communication channel and a link with its devoted users (Jang et al. 2008), (2) a cost reduction form that can be used in customer retention and customer service, and (3) a tool to increase sales, customer satisfaction, and brand image (Banks & Daus 2002). The Business and Management Review, Volume 8 Number 5 May 2017 International Conference on Business & Entrepreneurship, Supply Chain Management & Information Systems, Alexandria, Egypt, 239 However, in the participatory context of SNS, firms do not have the monopoly of brand-related communications anymore. The emergence of user generated social media brand communication has caused a paradigm shift from the publisher to the user-centric media model (Christodoulides, Jevons& Bonhomme 2012). According to Christodoulides et al. 2012, user generated social media brand communication can be stated as any material that is created outside professional practices, and have been published online. User generated social media brand communication can have various forms; the most common being consumer-produced reviews and recommendations (Mu \u0303niz & Schau 2007).Recent studies (e.g., Goh, Heng & Lin 2013, Schivinski & Dabrowski 2015) highlight the persuasive and convincing power of user generated social media brand communication over marketergenerated content. Since SNS are really dynamic and easy to use consumers are becoming pivotal authors of brand stories (Gensler et al. 2013). In this paper, firm-created and user-generated social media brand communications are considered to be independent variables and are expected to positively impact the CBBE dimensions. 2.3 Social media brand communication impact on CBBE dimensions Models of the CBBE construct have evolved over time, and have been a subject of controversy. Aaker (1991)defined CBBE based on a set of dimensions, which include brand awareness, brand associations,perceived quality, and brand loyalty.In addition to other proprietary brand assets such as competitive advantage. Keller\u2019s (1993) original model of CBBE involved two dimensions, brand awareness and brand image. Brand equity from this perspective occurs when a consumer is familiar with the brand and holds some favourable, strong, and unique brand associations in memory. However, Lassar et al. (1995) argue for a five-factor conceptualization comprised of performance, social image, value, trustworthiness, and attachment. Moreover, Yoo et al. (2000) stated that the CBBE dimensions include brand perceived quality, brand loyalty, and brand associations combined with brand awareness. Recently, few studies involved trust in their CBBE dimensions due to its importance. For example, Atilgan et ", "year": 2017}

Multi-modelling is a computational approach to combine models of systems and components for design and simulation of cyber physical systems and systems of systems. Despite potentially significant benefits in terms of more human-centric system modelling, there is limited evidence of the application of ergonomics within multi-modelling. This article presents the case for applying ergonomics within multi-modelling. We open with an introduction to multi-modelling and benefits, applications and gaps for ergonomics in multi-modelling, and of potentially useful models from ergonomics. We then describe a proof-of-concept implementation of ergonomics within a multi-model of UAV control. This demonstrates that as well as user-centred modelling, this approach supports ergonomics in how we can access rich systems models, and the collaborative value of applying ergonomics theory in systems design. Practitioner Summary: Examines multi-modelling, a computational approach for complex modelling, and the contribution of ergonomics. An autonomous UAV test implementation demonstrates the application of ergonomics knowledge for improving design and evaluation processes, and how multi-modelling can give ergonomics access to rich systems models.

We compared three different techniques for mapping the head turn to scrolling a list of numbers with and without haptic feedback. We found that the haptic feedback had no noticeable effect in objective metrics, but it sometimes improved user experience. Direct mapping of head orientation to list position is fast and easy to understand, but the signal-to-noise ratio of eye and head position measurement limits the possible range. The technique with constant rate of change after crossing the head angle threshold was simple and functional, but slow when the rate of change is adjusted to suit beginners.

Using airports as an example, the rapid growth in air travel demand has led to facility expansions and congested terminals, which directly impacts equity (e.g., increased challenges for Passengers with Reduced Mobility [PRMs]) and sustainability\u2014both of which are important metrics often overlooked during the engineering design process. Therefore, to evaluate systems and inform critical near- and long-term decisions more effectively, a holistic evaluation framework is proposed focused on four key areas: (1) mobility, with emphasis on travel time and accessibility within an airport, (2) environment, focused on energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with intra-airport mobility, (3) equity, specifically to the PRM community, but with an eye to the whole of society, and (4) built environment, or the fundamental changes in building design enabled by different mobility systems for larger and more flexible, functional, and energy-efficient structures. Below, AMPs are defined, and each metric is discussed further, all with a focus on airport mobility.Automated Mobility Platform (AMP): AMPs are broadly defined as mobility systems and/or services that leverage automation technologies to improve efficiency and reduce costs. In addition, advanced sensing and communications technologies are used in parallel with state-of-the-art methods in optimization and analytics to inform real-time decisions in complex operating environments. In the airport context, the AMPs system would consist of a mixed fleet of lightweight, electric vehicles that are centrally controlled and can reposition using automation technologies. At the same time, individual vehicles may also be equipped with a joystick/steering wheel to allow users to independently experience airport amenities \u2013 while larger vehicles designed for terminal-to-terminal movement may only operate in completely automated mode. AMPs benefits to equity and sustainability are closely tied to improved mobility (and user autonomy \u2013 not fully reliant on airport escorts) for PRMs and reduced energy consumption through the used of right-sized, lightweight electric vehicles that can be optimized to best respond to fluctuations in demand.Mobility: Mobility benefits were identified and evaluated through engagement with airport facility and disabled community stakeholders with emphasis on discerning requirements for PRMs at airports. As airports continue to expand, creating longer paths to traverse between curb drop-off and boarding gates, as well as between connecting gates, the ability to efficiently convey passengers along these paths without excessive delay is becoming more challenging. While automated vehicles will continue to evolve and at some point, allow people to navigate public roadways without physically driving the vehicle, evidence points toward a need to concurrently enhance mobility systems to serve large facilities in a similar fashion. This report analyzes and quantifies the challenges of transporting people\u2014both ambulatory and PRM\u2014through airports, as well as the fundamental limits that current airport design practice is confronting with respect to acceptable pedestrian travel times and distances.Environment: The energy and GHG benefits of airport mobility systems follow a near-term and long-term perspective. The near-term benefit assessment compares the energy consumption and GHG emissions for both PRM and non-PRM travelers. Long-term energy and GHG impacts are associated with building and facility design and functionality, enabling not only larger, more efficient tailored structures, but also more efficient regional transport by providing highly effective first-mile/last-mile services, and interfacing seamlessly with emerging electrified and automated roadway mobility services. This study evaluates the environmental impacts of current and future airport mobility options from a systems perspective \u2013 from strategic planning and facilities design to daily operations.Equity: Travel time and ease of pedestrian-related travel is closely associated with equity concerns of the PRM community. It is estimated that 20% or more of the traveling public possesses some type of disability or impairment that prevents them from being fully ambulatory and participating in routine walking, standing, and navigating functions within airports [1]. Some subpopulations can be identified and delineated within this group (such as those in need of daily wheelchair assistance or the legally blind), but the total number of PRMs is more difficult to enumerate, and the delineation is not purely a matter of binary classification. Natural human aging limits the ability to walk long distances, stand for long periods while boarding, or navigate complex terminals to find one\u2019s departure gate. With a growing portion of the aging population (air travel demand increasing at twice the rate compared to the general population [2]) and ever larger airport terminal complexes, more elderly people with physically diminished skills will continue to travel and require improved accommodation to effectively move through such facilities. This report presents findings related to the difficulties faced by vulnerable population groups in the airport setting and presents solutions to address and mitigate these challenges through AMPs technologies.Built Environment: The fourth dimension focuses on building design, and how different mobility systems and infrastructure impact facility performance. Currently, many different mobility options exist that span from the most rigid (moving walkways) to highly flexible (fleet of single passenger automated vehicles). This study will bring together expert knowledge and related literature to discuss near- and long-term impacts of mobility infrastructure on facilities and potential new designs enabled by various mobility systems.Overall, this report develops a holistic framework from which to evaluate different mobility systems and technologies in the large facility setting. The primary focus will be airports, however, similar approaches can be used for other large facilities, such as hospitals. AMPs will be the baseline for comparison, as they contain many characteristics (if deployed and managed intelligently) that can directly address issues related to mobility, environment, equity, and the built environment.", "year": 2023}

The research results of this paper solve the key technical problems of software development; in the actual development it can be adjusted to improve the applicability of the software. Introduction Credit card, also known as credit card, is issued by commercial banks or other financial institutions, according to the user's credit and financial resources issued to the cardholder, with consumer payments, credit loans, transfer settlement, access to cash and all the functions or some functions of the electronic payment. Card credit card business as a major part of the banking business, directly to financial institutions to bring annual fees, deposit spreads, special merchants fees and overdraft interest income, is an important source of profit banks. With the economic development, financial services demand provided by banks for individual are more and more, personal credit card business is also more and more important in the banking business. Economic globalization makes the market competition more and more intense, the economic knowledge and technology makes the product differentiation is getting smaller and smaller, homogeneity is getting higher and higher, just rely on a good product, can not form a competitive advantage, Good customer relationship to make long-term profits of the important guarantee [1]. Customer relationship management thought advocates from the long-term interests of enterprises, and customers to establish long-term and good relations, and through the maintenance of this benign relationship, to maximize customer value and maximize corporate profits. Customer relationship management can ease the pressure of highly competitive environment on the enterprise; can improve the profitability of enterprises. Customer relationship management has become the sustainable development strategy for commercial banks obtaining competitive advantage. The customer-centric business philosophy is the business purpose of commercial banks, but the lack of business model and process of implementing customer relationship management business philosophy. The proportion of credit card business in commercial banks is getting higher and higher, with the increase in the number of cards, simply rely on the number of cards to occupy the market and create profits is not feasible. Therefore, the development bank credit card customer relationship management system, the use of information science and technology, to achieve marketing, sales, service and other activities of automation, so that banks can more effectively provide customers with satisfactory and thoughtful service to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, And then improve the economic efficiency, and promote the sustainable development of bank information card business. 2nd International Conference on Materials Science, Machinery and Energy Engineering (MSMEE 2017) Copyright \u00a9 2017, the Authors.

research in university and industrial laboratories and changes people's lives when it becomes available to the masses. \nIn the interaction between technology and consumer, established designs in the

mainly carried out in laboratories or highly specialized environments. \nThe main goal was to generate systems that are ideal for a single user to conduct a particular task in VR. \n \nThe new emerging environments for the use of HMDs range from private homes to offices to convention halls. \nEven in public spaces such as public transport, cafes or parks, immersive experiences are possible. \nHowever, current VR systems are not yet designed for these environments. \nPrevious work on problems in the everyday environment deals with challenges such as preventing the user from colliding with a physical object. \nHowever, current research does not take into account the new social context for an HMD user associated with these environments. \nSeveral people who have different roles are around the user in these contexts. \nIn contrast to laboratory scenarios, the non-HMD user, for example, does not share the task with or is aware of the state of the HMD user in VR. \n \nThis thesis contributes to the challenges introduced by the social context. \nFor this purpose I offer solutions to overcome the visual separation of the HMD user. \nI also suggest methods for investigating and evaluating the use of HMDs suitable for everyday context. \n \nFirst, we present concepts and insights to overcome the challenges arising from an HMD covering the user's face. \nIn the private context, e.g., living rooms, one of the main challenges is the need for an HMD user to take off the HMD to be able to communicate with others. \nReasons for taking off the HMD are the visual exclusion of the surrounding world for HMD users and the HMD covering the users' face, hindering communication. \nAdditionally, the Non-HMD users do not know about the virtual world the HMD user is acting in. \nPrevious work suggests to visualize the bystanding Non-HMD user or its actions in VR to address such challenges. \nThe biggest advantage of a fully immersive experience, however, is the full separation from the physical surrounding with the ultimate goal of being at another place. \nTherefore I argue not to integrate a non-HMD users directly into VR. \nI introduce the approach of using a shared surface that provides a common basis for information and interaction between a non-HMD and a HMD user. \nSuch a surface can be utilized by using a smartphone. \nThe same information is presented to the HMD in VR and the Non-HMD user on the shared surface in the same physical position, enabling joint interaction at the surface. \nBy examining four feedback modalities, we provide design guidelines for touch interaction. \nThe guidelines support interaction design with such a shared surface by an HMD user. \nFurther, we explore the possibility to inform the Non-HMD user about the user's state during a mixed presence collaboration, e.g., if the HMD user is inattentive to the real world. \nFor this purpose I use a frontal display attached to the HMD. \nIn particular we explore the challenges of disturbed socialness and reduced collaboration quality, by presenting the users state on the front facing display. \nIn summary, our concepts and studies explore the application of a shared surface to overcome challenges in a co-located mixed presence collaboration. \n \nSecond, we look at the challenges of using HMDs in a public environment that have not yet been considered. \nThe use of HMDs in these environments is becoming a reality due to the current development of HMDs, which contain all necessary hardware in one portable device. \nRelated work, in particular, the work on public displays, already addresses the interaction with technology in public environments. \nThe form factor of the HMD, the need to take an HMD onto the head and especially the visual and mental exclusion of the HMD user are new and not yet understood challenges in these environments. \nWe propose a problem space for semi-public (e.g., conference rooms) and public environments (e.g., market places). \nWith an explorative field study, we gain insight into the effects of the visual and physical separation of an HMD user from surrounding Non-HMD users. \nFurther, we present a method that helps to design and evaluate the unsupervised usage of HMDs in public environments, the \\emph{audience funnel flow model for HMDs}. \n \nThird, we look into methods that are suitable to monitor and evaluate HMD-based experiences in the everyday context. \nOne core measure is the experience of being present in the virtual world, i.e., the feeling of ``being there''. \nConsumer-grade HMDs are already able to create highly immersive experiences, leading to a strong presence experience in VR. \nHence we argue it is important to find and understand the remaining disturbances during the experience. \nExisting methods from the laboratory context are either not precise enough, e.g, questionnaires, to find these disturbances or cause high effort in their application and evaluation, e.g., physiological measures. \nIn a literature review, we show that current research heavily relies on questionnaire-based approaches. \nI improve current qualitative approaches -- interviews, questionnaires -- to make the temporal variation of a VR experience assessable. \nI propose a drawing method that recognizes breaks in the presence experience. \nAlso, it helps the user in reflecting an HMD-based experience and supports the communication between an interviewer and the HMD user. \nIn the same paper, we propose a descriptive model that allows the objective description of the temporal variations of a presence experience from beginning to end. \nFurther, I present and explore the concept of using electroencephalography to detect an HMD user's visual stress objectively. \nObjective detection supports the usage of HMDs in private and industrial contexts, as it ensures the health of the user. \n \nWith my work, I would like to draw attention to the new challenges when using virtual reality technologies in everyday life. \nI hope that my concepts, methods and evaluation tools will serve research and development on the usage of HMDs. \nIn particular, I would like to promote the use in the everyday social context and thereby create an enriching experience for all.", "year": 2019}

Chapter VIII Design Agents with Negotiation Capabilities", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Agents are viewed as the next significant software abstraction, and it is expected they will become as ubiquitous as graphical user interfaces are today. Multi-agent systems have a key capability to reallocate tasks among their members, and this may result in significant savings and improvements in many domains, such as resource allocation, scheduling, ecommerce, etc. In the near future, agents will roam the Internet, selling and buying information and services. These agents will evolve from their present-day form\u0097simple carriers of transactions\u0097to efficient decision makers. It is envisaged that the decisionmaking processes and interactions between agents will be very fast (Kephart, 1998). The importance of automated negotiation systems is increasing with the emergence of new technologies supporting faster reasoning engines and mobile code. A central part of agent systems is a sophisticated reasoning engine that enables the agents to reallocate their tasks, optimize outcomes, and negotiate with other agents. The negotiation strategy used by the reasoning engine also requires high-level interagent communication protocols and suitable collaboration strategies. Both of these subsystems\u0097a reasoning engine and a collaboration strategy\u0097typically result in complicated agent designs and implementations that are difficult to maintain. Diversity in reasoning and strategies has led to \u0093homegrown\u0094 agent development done independently from scratch. This has led to the following problems (Bradshaw, 1997): \u0095 Lack of an agreed definition: Agents built by different teams have different capabilities. \u0095 Duplication of effort: There has been little reuse of agent architectures, designs, or components. \u0095 Inability to satisfy industrial strength requirements: Agents must integrate with existing software and computer infrastructure. They must also address security and scaling concerns. This chapter explores current concepts and directions in negotiation and collaboration strategies in Multi-agent systems. The focus is on coupling the theoretical underpinning of negotiation processes with trends and directions in software engineering and design. In particular, the implications of the theoretical work on design are discussed. In this chapter we provide an overview of different reasoning and negotiation strategies", "year": 2020}

Machine learning (ML) models are nowadays broadly adopted in modern state-of-the-art approaches to recommendation, which are typically trained to maximize a user-centred utility (e.g., user satisfaction) or a business-oriented one (e.g., profitability or sales increase). They work under the main assumption that users' historical feedback can serve as proper ground-truth for model training and evaluation. However, driven by the success in the ML community, recent advances show that state-of-the-art recommendation approaches such as matrix factorization (MF) models or the ones based on deep neural networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations applied on the input data. These adversarial samples can impede the ability for training high-quality MF models and can put the driven success of these approaches at high risk. As a result, there is a new paradigm of secure training for RS that takes into account the presence of adversarial samples into the recommendation process. We present adversarial machine learning in Recommender Systems (AML-RecSys), which concerns the study of effective ML techniques in RS to fight against an adversarial component. AML-RecSys has been proposed in two main fashions within the RS literature: (i) adversarial regularization, which attempts to combat against adversarial perturbation added to input data or model parameters of a RS and, (ii) generative adversarial network (GAN)-based models, which adopt a generative process to train powerful ML models. We discuss a theoretical framework to unify the two above models, which is performed via a minimax game between an adversarial component and a discriminator. Furthermore, we explore various examples illustrating the successful application of AML to solve various RS tasks. Finally, we present a global taxonomy/overview of the academic literature based on several identified dimensions, namely (i) research goals and challenges, (ii) application domains and (iii) technical overview.", "year": 2020}

The new retail begins with the development of an online to offline (O2O) mechanism to extend their online e-commerce to offline retailers. Nowadays, leading new retail players have been actively investing in offline retailers. Furthermore, they also evolve around technology-driven sales and cost efficiency to create online merge offline (OMO) services. This study used the Buynow Shanghai flagship store as an example and presents how to design and evaluate mini-programs for creating new retail OMO services for retailers. This study begins with the focus group interview to the three main business departments of the Buynow Shanghai flagship shopping mall. Then, we implemented a quality function deployment (QFD) analysis by referring to the interview results. Thirdly, we proposed the main functions, which can create the OMO service, of the mini-program prototypes by referring to the development priority proposed in QFD analysis. Finally, we design the user interface of the mini-programs and edit a simulated operational video to provide comprehensive introduction of the mini-programs and implemented the system usability scale (SUS) test to sample users. The results of this study show that the mini-programs can enable offline retailers to create omni-channel to customers. They also simplify and save time for the consumer's shopping experience.

The current \u201cone-size fits all approach\u201d to control-interfacing prevents nearly three million severely paralyzed consumers in the United States from being able to operate devices. This shortcoming even applies to technologies specifically designed to assist paralyzed persons. Such object relocation robots are designed to reduce nursing/assistance costs and improve the quality of life. These robots consist of a platform, an arm, and a gripper; each of which must be commanded by the user and controlled with precision. This paper describes the design of a Hands-free Interface for object relocation using a robot for paralyzed individuals. The design requirements were developed for a handsfree robotic-aid to be operated by an individual who is paralyzed using a three-degree of freedom kinematic simulation of 500 \u201cfetch-and-deliver\u201d tasks (consisting of random start and finish locations and arbitrary object to pick) for a robotic aid in a domestic setting. The simulation identified that six unique commands were necessary for platform movement, 500 for the arm, and two for the gripper. For these tasks, the top three commands for platform movement are: turn 18.5 degrees, move forward 5.2 meters, and turn 25.3 degrees. The high number of commands for the arm and gripper prevent a purely usercommanded interface from being feasible. To overcome this roadblock, an automated arm and gripper function is proposed. Once the robot platform is in range of the desired object, the function uses vision and other sensors to automatically position the arm and gripper to acquire the object utilizing a taggedobject camera image of the environment. A utility vs. life-cycle cost analysis is conducted on the following three design alternatives for hands-free platform commands: eye-tracking, brain-computer interface (BCI), and voice-commands. The utility function includes attributes such as capability, performance, proportion of paralyzed persons physically capable of using the interface, and technology readiness level (TRL). BCI is able to support the largest portion of potential users, but has the lowest utility (0.414) due to the limited number of input commands, significant calibration time costs, low TRL. Voice commands exhibited a marginally higher utility (0.8455) than the eye-tracking method (0.822). This difference is attributed to the increased number of commands and flexibility provided by voice-command technology. In a lifecycle cost vs. utility analysis, the voice-command method reveals half the cost of the eye-tracking method. To compete with existing user-interfaces, BCI technology must demonstrate a capabilities improvement of 200% and a performance increase of 73%. The Hands-Free Interface technology will have potential applications toward object relocation and vehicle guidance for non-disabled operators who are looking to multitask.

From the perspective of strategic management and based on Blue Sea strategy, this paper analyzes and studies the marketing strategy of famous and excellent brand, which is a popular brand. Under the decline of traditional physical retail industry and the popularity of online retail, this paper makes an analysis and research on the marketing strategy of famous products, which is one of the most popular brands in the world. Well-known products in more than two years in the world opened 1600 stores, including 1400 in the country, one time popular in the major cities in the country. The paper analyzes the secret of success of famous and excellent products from the point of view of marketing combination strategy. 1. Brief introduction to MINISO MINISO is the international famous leisure department store brand, is the chain business enterprise. It is a brand founded by a famous designer, San zhai Shun, and a pioneer and leader in the field of \"consumption of premium products in the world\". Products will \"return to nature\" as their own brand claim. Led by the global economic development, in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea and other fashion markets have blown up the \"quality of life consumption\" wind, the annual consumption of more than 10 million people. In various regions of China quickly opened their own world. At present, MINISO has opened and signed thousands of stores around the world, with an average of 80 to 100 new stores a month, growing rapidly. Promote the concept of quality life, and adhere to the brand spirit of \"respect consumers\", to provide consumers with truly \"high quality, creative, low price\" products, want consumers to think. The product has the natural simplicity characteristic, takes the low price new sharp line, the quality is fine and follows the global fashion trend. Most of the products priced at 10 yuan 2 9 yuan, by 18 to 35 years old small capital, white-collar and other mainstream consumers. MinISO also opened a new fashion leisure lifestyle collection shop, with catering, fast fashion clothing, Entertainment together becomes the main store of department stores and shopping centers, and while realizing the \"fast fashion\" consumption proposition of high-quality department stores, it also focuses on creating a brand-new fashion, leisure and shopping atmosphere, so that customers can experience happiness and fashion in consumption. A healthy way of life has won the attention and popularity of consumers. 2. The connotation of marketing combination Marketing mix is an important part of enterprise marketing strategy; it refers to the enterprise controllable marketing means to form a holistic activity. In 1964, American professor Eugene McCarthy summarized the content of marketing mix as \"4P\". The controllable factor refers to the internal environmental factors such as product (Produce), price, (Price), distribution (Place) and promotion (Promotion), while the uncontrollable factor refers to the political, legal and economic factors facing the enterprise. In the external environment, such as human and geography, the marketing activities of an enterprise are the process of adapting itself to the external environment by constantly adjusting the internal controllable factors, that is, through the planning, implementation 2019 3rd International Conference on Economics, Management Engineering and Education Technology (ICEMEET 2019) Copyright \u00a9 (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/icemeet.2019.180 905 and combination of products, prices, distribution, promotion, and so on. To adapt to the process of external uncontrollable factors, so as to meet the needs of the target customers, and achieve the marketing objectives of the enterprise. The following is a brief introduction to the \"4P\" strategy. Product strategy, including product design, product planning, product development and product delivery. Specific factors include product characteristics, quality, appearance, brand, trademark, packaging and after-sales service. Distribution strategy, also called channel strategy, mainly refers to the ways and methods used by enterprises to make products arrive in the hands of consumers. Promotion strategy is how to promote customers to purchase goods in order to achieve the strategy of expanding sales. There are four main ways of advertising, personnel promotion, business promotion and public relations. 3. MINISO's sales strategy analysis-based on blue sea strategy W. Qian Jin and Lenny Mobogne first put the Blue Sea strategy forward. Specifically, it can express if the whole market is compared to the ocean, the sea can be divided into two parts, one is red, the other is blue, and red is the industry that exists in our entire market. That is, we have opened up the industrial field; Blue Ocean said that the industry has not developed, is not yet out of the unknown market. Therefore, our so-called Blue Sea strategy is actually a corporate strategy that transcends the known areas we have opened up and develops the unknown areas of the market. 4. Marketing mix Strategy of MINISO At a time when physical retailing is facing the winter, MINISO has opened 1600 stores worldwide in more than two years, with sales of more than 10 billion yuan in 2016, and plans to open 6000 stores around the world by 2020, achieving the target of 60 billion. With the impact of the Internet economy, the sales volume of the real retail industry has declined year by year, and under the condition of the difficult operation, why MINISO has become a shining star in the retail industry against the tide of e-commerce, I think it has something to do with its unique marketing mix strategy. Following the author from the product, the price, the market, the diversification management four sides Lets analyze MINISO's marketing mix strategy. 4.1 Product Design to return to Nature and restore the essence of Life. MINISO's chief designer, Mitsuzaku, also graduated from the Japanese Academy of Culture and clothing, a world-renowned fashion hall. His design style is famous for its simplicity, nature and richness. The products designed by San shun also operate knives naturally blend the simple design style, and its brand products do not emphasize luxury and grandeur, fashion, but make the products return to nature and restore the true nature of the products. This product design, which returns to nature and reverts to the essence of life, embodies the idea that enterprises benefit from the people, truly bringing tangible benefits to contemporary consumers, but also leaving beautiful nature to later generations of consumers. 4.2 Take the leisure department store product as the main brand. MINISO's creative products are mainly based on life and leisure department stores, including creative home, health and beauty, trendy ornaments, office supplies, stylistic gifts, seasonal products and other 8 categories, more than 10 000-product types. Miniso pursues a simple design style. Every product developed from a user's point of view, focusing on the rationality of the product and the durability of its use. And the product quality is strictly managed, from the supplier's screening and quality control, product quality control mechanism improvement, quality upgrading, layer by layer control. They are constantly pursuing the perfection of quality. 4.3 In-depth understanding of consumer demand.

We suggest that this is due to insufficient consideration of key factors that influence the perception and effectiveness of agent-based interfaces. We propose a framework for studying anthropomorphic agents that can systematize the research. The framework emphasizes features of the agent, the user, and the task the user is performing. Our initial experiment within this framework manipulated the agent\u2019s appearance (lifelike versus iconic) and the nature of the user\u2019s task (carrying out procedures versus providing opinions). We found that the perception of the agent was strongly influenced by the task while features of the agent that we manipulated had little effect. Introduction If you could ask for assistance from a smart, spoken natural language help system, would that be an improvement over an on-line reference manual? Presumably the answer, in most cases, is yes, for two reasons. First, the spoken natural language aspect would allow you to speak your questions rather than having to type them. Generally this is a faster approach for most people. Second, the smart aspect would improve the chance of the help system finding the information you want even if you do not state the query using the correct or most appropriate terms. The state of the art in this style of interface is a human user consultant. Does it matter that the user consultant has a face and that the face can have expressions and convey a personality? Would a face affect you in terms of your comfort and satisfaction with the interaction? Would the presence of a face make the help or advice you receive more persuasive? The answers to such questions have implications for the design of training systems, customer service, information kiosks, and many other applications. Many people believe that anthropomorphic computer interfaces have great potential to be beneficial for a number of reasons. Agents could act as smart assistants, much like travel agents or investment advisors, helping people manage the ever-growing amount of information encountered today (Lyman & Varian, 2002). Further, a conversational interface appears to be a natural dialog style in which the user does not have to learn complex command structure and functionality (Laurel, 1990). An anthropomorphic interface could use intonation, gaze patterns, and facial expressions, in addition to words, for conveying information and affect. The human face seems to occupy a privileged position for conveying a great deal of information, including relatively subtle information, efficiently (Fridlund & Gilbert, 1985). Anthropomorphic interfaces could make a computer more human-like, engaging, entertaining, approachable, and understandable to the user, thus harboring potential to build trust and establish relationships with users, and make them feel more comfortable with computers. These potential advantages are balanced by strong negatives. Anthropomorphic agent interfaces are viewed by some researchers as being impractical and inappropriate. Current speech recognition, natural language understanding, and learning capabilities of computers still fall far short of any human assistant. More specifically, it has been proposed that agent systems disempower users by clouding issues such as who is responsible for a system\u2019s actions (Lanier, 1995). Others feel that user interfaces are more beneficial when they clearly reflect the commands available to a user and present the objects that a user can act upon (Shneiderman, 1997). Furthermore, critics argue that agent interfaces may mislead both users and designers, increase user anxiety, reduce user control, undermine user responsibility, and destroy a user\u2019s sense of accomplishment (Shneiderman & Maes, 1997). Many current anthropomorphic or personified interfaces are viewed as being annoying, silly characters who hinder rather than enhance productivity (e.g., the Microsoft Paper Clip). Although strong opinions have been voiced on both sides of this issue, relatively little careful empirical research on anthropomorphic interfaces has been conducted, and the results from this research have been contradictory or equivocal (Cassell, 2000). Our goal is to develop a framework to systematically evaluate and understand the autonomous agent as a user interface paradigm. The present paper outlines the framework and an initial study that examines two issues within this framework. The first is whether the degree to which an interface agent is anthropomorphic has a measurable effect on users. Note that anthropomorphism is not a dichotomy but rather a continuum. One can think of interfaces with full fidelity video or 3D images of people to", "year": 2019}

This research paper centres around the hypothesis that games have the potential to foster interaction and provide experiences that go beyond their mechanics and design, leveraging the customization options available to players. To explore this concept, an online survey was conducted, supported by a theoretical framework drawing from the fields of design, media, and psychology. The survey aimed to investigate the prevalence of customization practices, examining how players acquire customizations for games and how these personalization enhance their overall gaming experience. The findings underscored the significance of customization as a prominent aspect of gaming and revealed that players derive enjoyment from engaging in this activity, considering it an integral part of their gaming journey.

Better yet, the advent of social media makes some male customers more of a target audience than some women. Local advertising is relatively cheaper and endears itself to the residents, thus creating an unmatched reputation. Later, scaling-up makes a business go national. In this scope, local and national advertising is good for reputation and expansion respectively. The legacy, interactive, and social media platforms as well have their merits and demerits, making them unreliable when executed individually; a perfect blend of the three is necessary for success. Introduction The scentless environmental-friendly product that the startup plans to deal with is a viable venture with a market niche. Making the market more targeted takes full advantage of the market gap. The paper focuses on the advertisement spectrum based on the region and nature of the advertisement. Five scenarios of local, national, legacy, social, and interactive media advertisements come into view. The guiding hypothesis is that legacy, interactive, and social media platforms are stand-alone initiatives, and establishing the viability of each choice is of utmost significance. Target Customers As currently stipulated, the target market is the women who have attained a minimum academic qualification of a college education. They have an income ranging from $40000 to $125000 and fall within the age bracket of 30 to 65 years. The attempt by the startup to develop environment-friendly scentless cleaning products is an expression of interest to safeguard the well-being of the planet by insisting on reducing the carbon footprint. Also, it is conscious of the health of the individuals it targets. The search parameters for prospective customers could, therefore, include environment conservationists. Though unethical, the startup could cash in on the good name associated with companies in this industry that give back to the community through CSR initiatives. Therefore, it is essential to target compassionate people associated with philanthropy (Fong et al., 2015). Since this is an evaluation of social media platforms, and their suitability to improve effectiveness, the age of target customers could be lowered further because of their relatively high activity online. Merits and Demerits of Media Platforms Local media Local Newspaper Advertising One essential merit is affordability. This convenience comes handy for cash crunch startups, which are trying to stave off wastages. Compared to other levels, they are localized, but cheap in the process. The business could leverage the benefit of targeted, loyal audiences who are either hooked or have no alternative. Embracing local outlets is a gateway to propping an excellent reputation as a reward for coverage. They are a perfect front to ensure precision compared to the equivalent online platforms, which cannot guarantee this. Finally, the concept of loyalty and promotion of local growth could increase the number of job listings on such local pages from employers, which consequently leads to more sales (more traffic) (Greenwood et al., 2016). This result is a self-sustaining cycle. The main demerit lies in the limitation of the reach of the target market. There is little space for scaling up in the future without going regional or national. National media National T.V. Advertising The national media outlets have a broader audience reach compared to the lower level platforms. The comparison of the number of viewers between some of the largest T.V. news channels highlights this point. Back in 2017, the second quarter saw CNN report 1.06 million viewers, whereas MSNBC and Fox reported 1.64 and 2.35 million viewers in primetime. If the company could find a way of working down the operation cost and other associated expenditures, it will be better off. The significant increase in viewers does not come cheap, making it more costly (Sridhar et al., 2016). The increased number of viewers does not guarantee an increase in the number of targeted prospective consumers. The startup cannot establish whether the target audience will always be seated and viewing at the time of broadcasting. Legacy Media Direct Mail Advertising Legacy media done using Direct Mail Advertising has one of the highest selectivity rates in choosing the target audience. Its selectivity pays off through high response rates. Because it allows one to select the prospective clients they communicate to, their experience could be as personalized as possible. Also, the team tasked with completing the advert maintain a level of control to offer high quality of the broadcast. The backlash is an associated high cost per exposure. The operation's nature has correlations with the market (Felix et al., 2017). The targeted people receive very many emails (spam) that are a bother. There is a negative attitude associated with purchasing through the mail. Interactive Media The Amazon.com Amazon is a leader in terms of how it has designed and implemented this concept to leverage consumer information to enhance their shopping experience. Interactive media finds strength from a dialogic form of communication that promotes communication from both ends of the line. This manner of contact establishes a mutual understanding that fosters trust and understanding. It is an opportunity for the startup's marketing division to embrace an approach that appreciates the full range of behavioral spectrum rather than just sticking to the typical essential marketing. Its appreciation for diversity is evident in the possibility of implementation in many fronts of technology. They are not only limited to mobile smartphone platforms and other smart-based embedded systems designed to display movies, prompt for input of command and other special requests, then output some result of the operation. Even better, they can be built on virtually any programming language and can predict scenarios in the future as a function of Artificial intelligence (Felix et al., 2017). The limit to their optimization is the lagging growth in technology that can support the nature of systems needed and the subsequent high cost of design development and installation. It is essential for the startup to monitor Amazon's operation closely and or liaise with them. Social Media Facebook Over 80% of U.S. citizens can access the internet, which allows them to access a large pool of markets. Imagine the implication of accessing LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Snapchat, and Twitter users who represent a percentage of 25%, 35%, 68%, 29%, 73%, 27% and 24% U.S. adults respectively (Greenwood et al., 2016). They create an opportunity to have a more direct connection with the target audience. It also offers the chance to subscribe to paid adverts (Facebook ads), which are more targeted and, thus, surgical. The leads and hits can enhance the process of building a brand, and the startup can finally drive traffic to their website using viral content (Greenwood et al., 2016). However, note that the negative feedbacks and other potential adverts could hurt the reputation of the firm. It involves spending a significant amount of time resources. A closer look at the mode of selection of the desired audience for the scentless environmental-friendly product ad is vital. The location would be the U.S., the target audience should like social media, and it is crucial to avoid wastage by excluding people who already love using the cleaning product. The adjusted target age group should be noted as has been prescribed. Recommendation Note that there is no specific exclusive advert option. In the geographic reach (level) of advert, the startup must secure the base consumers by ramping up concerted local advertising to take advantage of its economy and establish an excellent reputation it can ride on to scale up. The startup has the backing to support probable acceptability countrywide, and as such, it must take advantage of it (Delmas et al., 2013). Since there is funding to sustain it, despite its significant expenditure, the company could count on the returns associated with a broad target audience. Local to national appropriation is thus projected at 5% to 95% in this scope. Exploded pie in 3-D depicting budget allocation by region. Legacy shows a promise of precision and efficiency at the expense of being a bother and a lack of trust. This drawback does not warrant scrapping it off. The mistrust levels off due to the convenience of conversation-based communication of interactive platforms, limited by technology advancement and other capital. Social media steps in with a surge in the audience and make it possible to target it at a cost (Delmas et al., 2013). It claps back with negative responses that could jeopardize the standing of the startup. Consider 10%, 34%, and 56% for legacy, interactive, and social media platforms. A pie chart representing the recommendations made to the startup. Conclusion The environment-friendly scentless cleaning product has a broader target market that the projections at hand. The significant usage of interactive and social media platforms for adverts also undercuts some sections of the market. It is essential to underscore the observation that no advert platform is stand-alone. Therefore, a perfect blend of the three is vital to realize better turnover and markup. The same applies to both the local and national platforms. References Delmas, M. A., Nairn-Birch, N., &Balzarova, M. (2013). Choosing the right eco-label for your product.

Video commentary, synchronous or asynchronous, is indispensable in viewers' engagement and participation, and may in turn contribute to video with additional information and emotions. Yet, the roles of video commentary in crisis communications are largely unexplored, which we believe that an investigation not only provides timely feedback but also offers concrete guidelines for better information dissemination. In this work, we study two distinct commentary features of online videos: traditional asynchronous comments and emerging synchronous danmaku. We investigate how users utilize these two features to express their emotions and share information during a public health crisis. Through qualitative analysis and applying machine learning techniques on a large-scale danmaku and comment dataset of Chinese COVID-19-related videos, we uncover the distinctive roles of danmaku and comments in crisis communication, and propose comprehensive taxonomies for information themes and emotion categories of commentary. We also discover the unique patterns of crisis communications presented by danmaku, such as collective emotional resonance and style-based highlighting for emphasizing critical information. Our study captures the unique values and salient features of the emerging commentary interfaces, in particular danmaku, in the context of crisis videos, and further provides several design implications to enable more effective communications through online videos to engage and empower users during crises.", "year": 2021}

A wide variety of opinions exist, ranging from the view that patients should assume at least some responsibility for their own treatment, to the position that it is unwise to encourage such participation because patients do not have the specialised knowledge required to make treatment decisions (Degner, Sloan, 1992). The difficult process of shared decision making (SDM), is a process in which the physician shares with the patient all relevant risk and benefit information on all treatment alternatives and the patient shares with the physician all relevant personal information that might make one treatment or side effect more or less tolerable than others (King, Eckman, a Moulton, 2011). SDM is currently being advocated by both healthcare professionals and patients as the ideal for decision making (Stiggelbout, Pieterse, a De Haes, 2015). The process of SDM is difficult to implement, for example because it has proven difficult to create access to balanced and easy to understand information for patients. The difficulty of implementing SDM also applies to adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions regarding patients with colon cancer. This decision-making moment occurs after surgery when the pTNM-classification (UICC, 2010) shows a certain value which suggests if adjuvant chemotherapy is applicable. During the multidisciplinary consultation (IKNL, n.d.) the best treatment option is discussed in the eyes of the physicians. This is then shared with the patient during the consultation with the oncological surgeon. During the next consultation with the oncologist, it is expected of the patient to make a final treatment decision. Different research methodologies like literature research, semi-structured interviews and observations were performed to obtain the understanding of the current decision-making procedure concerning adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer patients. The insights obtained from the observations and semi-structured interviews, were used to create the patient physician experience journey. Combining this with the theoretical framework, the design goal for this project emerged. The aim of the design process was to Create a User Interface for a web application that ensures that both patient and physician are aware of the different possible treatment options, understand what these treatment options involve concerning risks, treatment options and possible outcome, according to the principles of risk communication, and that interaction can take place, so that the preferences and values of both patient and physician can be shared, to support the process of SDM concerning adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer patients. From the patient physician experience journey, combined with the theoretical framework, the IPD was created through multiple iteration steps, involving physicians, patients, and potential patients. The IPD allows the patient to find general information about adjuvant chemotherapy, and triggers the patient to think about their preferences and values concerning quality of life, which can be scored and communicated with the treating physicians. Added to that, the patient and physician are both enabled to gain insights from prediction information about life expectancy. The IPD allows both patient and physician to be aware of the same amount of information and to understand what this information entails, which, according to the literature, is the condition to be able to implement the SDM process properly. Because this project was carried out in the name of IKNL, the IPD was created for a small fraction of the numerical information database they possess, with the purpose to be able to project the principle of the IPD on their entire database to help as many cancer patients as possible with their valuable information. When patients are more involved in making treatment decisions based on the process of SDM, it may have influenced the patient experience in a positive was, leading to a better quality of life of the patient. When the quality of life of the patient is improved due to the provided care, it can be said that the quality of care has also improved.", "year": 2018}

Community-based interventions that include evidence-based principles of group dynamics are effective at improving individual-level physical activity behaviors as well as changing social norms for health behaviors. The use of technologies such as smartwatches has a potential to channel and amplify underlying group dynamics principles in such interventions. In order to explore the use of smartwatches for group dynamics-based physical activity interventions, a smartwatch centered system was designed and deployed as part of an eight-week pilot study. Objectives: The primary goal of this study was to explore the degree to which smartwatches effectively channel group dynamics strategies in the context of an eight-week community based physical activity intervention. Methods: In this explanatory mixed-methods study, system usage data were analyzed (e.g., frequency of interaction with smartwatch and smartphone) and participant physical activity (e.g., participant steps tracked by the system). To provide a richer picture of the user experience, use of features, and impact of group dynamics, participants were invited to participate in one-on-one interviews after the pilot program. The group dynamics-based questions centered on the individual\u2019s attraction to the group task and socially as well as the individual\u2019s perception of group integration around the task and as a social unit (i.e., the four dimensions of cohesion). The interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed via an abbreviated grounded theory approach. The system usage data was visually and numerically summarized. Results: Five of the seven participants completed interviews. The interview analysis resulted in 365 meaning units representing 2 themes (related to user experience with devices and manifestations of group dynamic principles), 4 sub-themes and 23 categories. The participants completed 31.3 (SD=2.91) miles per week and engaged with the smartwatch and the Android app 2.6 and 1.5 times a day, respectively. Analysis of interviews and the system usage logs from five participants, reveal sustained engagement with the smartwatch and the smartphone app. The system facilitated self-reflection and awareness in terms of physical activity levels, encouraged interactions with the team members and helped them to stay aware of the daily goals. Additionally, the participants reported habit formation in terms of wearing and using the smartwatch on the daily basis. Implications: This study provides preliminary support that accessible information via the custom smartwatch watchface can be a viable solution for retaining higher participant engagement during group dynamics-based community interventions. Such devices can help expand group-dynamics interventions by making them less depended on in-person delivery methods.

It is a product of cognitive sensorimotor integration processes and by manipulating what we see and feel, we can extend the perceived boundaries of our bodies to include non-biological objects. Consequently, it is of interest to many human-robotic control applications that aim to promote the seamless interaction of the human user and machine. The sense of embodiment has three constituent components that robotic systems may engage with: the Sense of Ownership (SoO), the Sense of Agency (SoA), and our peripersonal space (PPS). Despite the recognitionthat each is linked to the other, how these components interact to form a cohesive sense of embodiment remains poorly understood.

With the advances in this field, however, the need for a more multidisciplinary approach to embedded systems education has arisen, as modern embedded systems design relies heavily on the integration of both hardware and software design. Due to the diverse backgrounds that are becoming not only recommended, but also required, providing students with an educational experience of the holistic design of a modern embedded system is becoming a bigger challenge. Both the Electrical and Computer Engineering curricula and the Computer Science curricula are filled to overflowing with required courses as well as upper-level technical electives to provide opportunities to explore the application of students\u2019 knowledge in depth in particular fields. How then do we develop an Embedded Systems course that provides this holistic design in the limited amount of time afforded by a quarter or semester course? One approach that has been tested in Baylor University\u2019s School of Engineering & Computer Science (ECS) is the integration of the Embedded Systems Design course taught in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with the Embedded Systems course taught in Computer Science. [1] This paper will document the original courses and their prerequisite coursework, the path toward integration of the group design project, the prototype testing of this approach conducted in 2017, an outline of the instruction provided to the students, and the assessment of the interdisciplinary approach to the project phase of both courses. Introduction Over the past decade computer technology has become ubiquitous in our everyday lives. From digital camera, to the embedded systems that make up current vehicles, to automated highways, to home security systems, to automated household appliances, to robotic manufacturing, to integrated medical devices, to communications systems, even the term \u201cembedded systems\u201d has transcended previous definitions to now embody any \u201cengineering artifact involving computation that is subject to physical constraints.\u201d [2] These are examples of some of the implementations of embedded systems design that are pushing existing technology to its limits, and going past many existing applications, and forcing us to rethink our process of teaching this subject. In today\u2019s automotive industry, as each new vehicle design receives yet another control unit, \u201csoftware complexity escalates to the point that current development processes and tools can no longer ensure sufficiently reliable systems at affordable cost.\u201d [3] In this challenge lies an opportunity for the disciplines of computer science and electrical engineering to recognize the need for professionals who are able to bridge the divide between the disciplines and \u201cintegrate computation and physicality for the bottom up,\u201d using non-traditional design methods. [4],[5] In Baylor University\u2019s School of Engineering and Computer Science, two existing courses in embedded systems, each taught from differing perspectives, have joined to integrate software and hardware design and implementation in their group projects. This paper will discuss the existing courses, the design and development of multi-disciplinary group projects, implementation of these projects, and lessons learned in the beta test of this design. Research Goals The goal of this experiment was to determine whether the students involved in a multidisciplinary group project had a better, more enhanced experience than those not participating in a multi-disciplinary group, as measured by a pre-project survey and a post-project survey. ELC 4438, \u201cEmbedded Systems Design\u201d ELC 4438, \u201cEmbedded Systems Design,\u201d has been taught as a required upper-level course in Baylor University\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering, currently deployed in a 4-hour semester course. Although the focus is mainly on the design and implementation of embedded computer systems using microcontrollers, sensors and data conversion devices, actuators, visual display devices, timers, and applications specific circuits, it also includes some software design using microprocessor cross-development systems and real-time operating system principles. The main objective of the course is for students to learn to design and implement embedded computer solutions that meet specific system needs and/or requirements. In addition, during the course students are expected to: 1. Demonstrate understanding of embedded system design criteria 2. Design embedded systems and produce design rationale 3. Implement embedded system software solutions 4. Demonstrate understanding of real-time scheduling, priorities, and operating systems 5. Select hardware solutions that meet physical, computational, and interface requirements 6. Demonstrate a basic understanding of the Internet of Things (IoT) and distributed systems 7.

This study investigates the feasibility of using laser ranging technology (LiDAR) for this purpose. The proposed technology does not experience some of the problems of the current video-based technology but less expensive lowend sensors have limited density of points where measurements are collected that may bring new challenges. A novel LiDAR-based portable traffic scanner (TScan) is introduced in this report to detect and track various types of road users (e.g., trucks, cars, pedestrians, and bicycles). The scope of this study included the development of a signal processing algorithm and a user interface, their implementation on a TScan research unit, and evaluation of the unit performance to confirm its practicality for safety and traffic engineering applications. The TScan research unit was developed by integrating a Velodyne HDL-64E laser scanner within the existing Purdue University Mobile Traffic Laboratory which has a telescoping mast, video cameras, a computer, and an internal communications network. The low-end LiDAR sensor\u2019s limited resolution of data points was further reduced by the distance, the light beam absorption on dark objects, and the reflection away from the sensor on oblique surfaces. The motion of the LiDAR sensor located at the top of the mast caused by wind and passing vehicles was accounted for with the readings from an inertial sensor atop the LiDAR. These challenges increased the need for an effective signal processing method to extract the maximum useful information. The developed TScan method identifies and extracts the background with a method applied in both the spherical and orthogonal coordinates. The moving objects are detected by clustering them; then the data points are tracked, first as clusters and then as rectangles fit to these clusters. After tracking, the individual moving objects are classified in categories, such as heavy and nonheavy vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. The resulting trajectories of the moving objects are stored for future processing with engineering applications. The developed signal-processing algorithm is supplemented with a convenient user interface for setting and running and inspecting the results during and after the data collection. In addition, one engineering application was developed in this study for counting moving objects at intersections. Another existing application, the Surrogate Safety Analysis Model (SSAM), was interfaced with the TScan method to allow extracting traffic conflicts and collisions from the TScan results. A user manual also was developed to explain the operation of the system and the application of the two engineering applications. Experimentation with the computational load and execution speed of the algorithm implemented on the MATLAB platform indicated that the use of a standard GPU for processing would permit real-time running of the algorithms during data collection. Thus, the post-processing phase of this method is less time consuming and more practical. Evaluation of the TScan performance was evaluated by comparing to the best available method: video frame-by-frame analysis with human observers. The results comparison included counting moving objects; estimating the positions of the objects, their speed, and direction of travel; and counting interactions between moving objects. The evaluation indicated that the benchmark method measured the vehicle positions and speeds at the accuracy comparable to the TScan performance. It was concluded that the TScan performance is sufficient for measuring traffic volumes, speeds, classifications, and traffic conflicts. The traffic interactions extracted by SSAM required automatic post-processing to eliminate vehicle interactions at too low speed and between pedestrians \u2013 events that could not be recognized by SSAM. It should be stressed that this post processing does not require human involvement. Nighttime conditions, light rain, and fog did not reduce the quality of the results. Several improvements of this new method are recommended and discussed in this report. The recommendations include implementing two TScan units at large intersections and adding the ability to collect traffic signal indications during data collection.", "year": 2016}

A CASE STUDY OF PT XYZ", "abstract": "The automotive industry is one of the most lucrative market in Jakarta, Indonesia. There are opportunities coming from the low car density, a growing number of middle class and the first-time buyers in Jakarta. On the other hand, there are also challenges car manufactures face that could curtail car sales such as, the presence new public transport, the increase on vehicle tax, and the existence of online taxis. Currently, studies related to car ownership motivation according to the future generation of buyer are still limited. Therefore, this study examined the significance between car ownership deterrents, car ownership motivation, and car purchase decision. This study also analysed the preference of cars according to young people, being the future generation in Jakarta. The final objective was to provide PT XYZ a selection of strategies to anticipate such phenomena. The methodology used was Structural Equation Modelling. The result revealed that car ownership motivation and car purchase decision were significantly correlated, while car ownership motivation and car ownership deterrents showed otherwise. Car attributes such as safety, performance, and convenience were considered as the most important criteria according to young people. The managerial implication for PT XYZ is to consider market penetration, market development, and product development. Keywords\u2014 Car ownership motivation, Car ownership deterrents, Car purchase decision, Structural Equation Modelling, Strategic Management I. INTRODUCTION I.1. BACKGROUND Car ownership is an essential factor for the urban dwellers. As the GDP increases, people are more encouraged to purchase an expensive need, such as car (Tanner, 1978). Many motorcycle owners are also converting to four-wheeled vehicles. This phenomenon happens in many developing countries in Southeast-Asia, including Indonesia. Data from Gaikindo (2017) showed that apart from the global economic crisis in 2009, Indonesia is a lucrative market for automotive industry. In 2016, there were 1.10 millions of cars sold in the country. In addition, the new growing working-age population of 21 million people (Scherer, et al., 2016) become one of the driving forces of the current demand of private cars. Furthermore, the low car density level also makes Indonesia a lucrative market according to global automotive brands to expand the business in the country (Jody, 2016). As in 2016, there are only 70 motor vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in Indonesia (Nangoi, 2016). This number is remarkably low for Indonesia (rank #124), compared to Singapore (#90), Thailand (#69), and Malaysia (#47). Despite the opportunities from low car density and the growing demand from middle class and first time buyers, there are some challenges that car manufacturers could face in the future. In Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, heavy traffic congestion urges the local administrator to shift the commuters from private cars into using public transportation, such as Transjakarta, Commuter-Line (PT KAI), and Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) that will become fully integrated in 2018. Nevertheless, the proportion of commuters using public transport dropped from 35.5% in 2002 to 12.9% in 2010 (Sumaedi, et al., 2014), due to the slow development, access difficulty, and often overcrowded carriage. The other threat comes electronic ride-hailing applications. According to Kaas, et al (2016) and Liem (2015), consumers today wish for more flexibility in selecting the best choice for a specific journey that can be requested via their smartphones in real time. This new business model provides a competitive value for car manufacturers, as e-hailing app users are no longer burdened by the common expenses of private cars, such as vehicle taxations and parking fees. Moreover, there is a trend that comes from the young commuter (aged 16 to 24 years old). Kaas, et al. (2016) predicts that there will be a change in mobility choice by young people, where car ownership is declining and car sharing is growing. This trend has started in more developed countries such as North America and Germany. It is predicted that by 2030, one out of ten new cars sold may be likely to be a shared car. Another challenge comes from a limited range of cars offered car manufacturers in Indonesia. A study by J.D. Power (2016) reveals that many potential buyers are experiencing frustration because of a small selection of models readily offered by the car manufacturers that satisfy their needs. Moreover, smaller players have aggressively invested in cars customisation for Indonesia market in 2014 and this is starting to get results as it gains market share from its top rivals. In addition, other competitors had recruited local design engineers to create interior and exterior attributes that reflect on Indonesian preference (Wijeratne & Lau, 2015). This study aims to analyse the car ownership motivation and car purchase decision according to young people in Jakarta and surrounding cities. As the future car buyers, understanding their buying behaviour and preference of cars is important for any car manufacturers in order to optimise the presence in the market. I.2. RESEARCH PROBLEM There are some opportunities such as low car density and growing demand of private cars from middle class and first-time buyers in Indonesia, and threats such as the presence of new public transportations, and e-hailing applications. In addition, there has been a frustration of Indonesian consumer because of the small selection of cars offered in the market. Understanding the challenges and utilising the potentials are critical, in order to optimise the market position. In addition, assessing car buying behaviour and preferences according to young people is beneficial as they are the next generation of buyers. This study uses PT XYZ as the case study. As one of the market leaders in Indonesia, PT XYZ needs a suitable strategy to anticipate the aforementioned issues in order to maintain its position in the industry. I.3. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES There are several objectives of this research: 1. To analyse the motivation of a car ownership in Jakarta, according to young people aged 17 to 30 years old. 2. To analyse the preference of a car for young people in Jakarta. 3. To examine whether a car ownership deterrents affect car ownership motivation. 4. To examine whether a car ownership motivation affects the purchase decision of car. 5. To develop the most suitable strategic planning for PT XYZ. II. LITERATURE REVIEW This study, the variables analysed are car ownership motivation, car ownership deterrents, and car purchase decision. II.1. CAR OWNERSHIP MOTIVATION Steg (2005) examined the motives of car ownership and classified it into three factors: symbolic/affective, instrumental (functional), and independence. Furthermore, Van and Fujii (2011) added a new dimension of social orderliness as the determinant for car ownership motivations. In addition, Belgiawan, et al. (2014) stated that car ownership levels are rising remarkably in many developing nations due to the improvement of income status and GDP. It is important to see the motivation of car ownership into the preference of a buyer in purchasing a car. Cullinane (2002), focused her research on young people from several universities in Hong Kong and discovered the correlation between car ownership variables and income level per household. This study also included some other indicators that in extent could motivate people in owning their own car. The factors are the attitude towards traffic condition, the degree of wanting a car, and gender differences. Additionally, Matas and Raymond (2008) added that besides income, quality of public transport, employment model, number of cars per household plays a significant role in influencing the motivation. Measuring the motivations of car ownership can be more complex as there are not only social, but also psychological factors involved (Shende, 2014). If the gesture toward a certain mode of transport is positive, it will result in a higher utilisation of the chosen mode. In other words, the mode choice depends on the attitude toward travel mode (Van Acker, 2010). The concept of car ownership motivation as constructed by Steg (2005), Van & Fujii (2011), and Belgiawan, Sch\u00f6cker, & Fujii, (2012) are further explained below: \u2022 Symbolic/affective The affective aspect examines the emotions evoked from driving a car, such as feelings of sensation, power, superiority, and thrill. Whereas, the symbolic aspect is related to pride and status of ownership and driving. Moreover, symbolic and affective values are determined by individual behavioural beliefs and social norms (Zhu, et al., 2012). Cars are made to appeal to people\u2019s desire for control (Gardner & Abraham, 2007), power, social status, and self-esteem. Affective and symbolic values are drawn to make contrast from instrumental value, that are more objectively measurable. \u2022 Instrumental/functional This motive discusses the fundamental use of a car as mode of transportation. It mainly focuses on the apparent functionalities of car itself, such as mobility channel, speed, flexibility, and convenience (Steg, 2005). One may own cars because they concern on personal space and want to minimise the physical and physiological effort (Gardner & Abraham, 2007) in commuting. \u2022 Independence Cars allow people to travel anytime and anywhere (Steg, 2005), to gain freedom, as well as to help save time to travel (Hagman, 2003). Therefore, they become more independent. This reasons are valued by car users and one of the motivator for their eventual purchase of a car (Belgiawan, Schm\u00f6cker, & Fujii, 2012). Despite having the instrumental aspect, independence differs from a time variable point of view. \u2022 Social Orderliness This motive comes from the social peers and neighbours that influence people in their attitude towards car ownership. The choice of transportation mode in the past also", "year": 2017}

The system has diffusers with individually operable flaps that facilitate asymmetric air inlet to control air flow inside a room in an effective way. Moreover, the system involves distributed temperature sensors, a user interface, and a control unit that allows creation and management of \u201cthermal subzones\u201d within a room in accordance with the different preferences of occupants. As a specific case, the thermal management of a typical office in an academic building is considered. Both experimental and numerical studies were conducted to show that it is possible to achieve several degrees of temperature differences at different room locations in a transient and controllable fashion. The dynamic management of the temperature distribution in a room can prevent the waste of conditioning energy. It is shown that the system provides a practical and impactful solution by adapting to different user preferences (UPs) and by minimizing the resource use. In order to deal with the complexity of design, development, and operation of the system, it is considered as a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS). The core of the CPSS approach used here is an enhanced hybrid system modeling methodology that couples human dimension with formal hybrid dynamical modeling. Based on a coherent conceptual framing, the approach can combine the three core aspects, like cyber infrastructure, physical dynamics, and social/human interactions of modern building energy systems to accommodate the environmental challenges. Besides physics-based achievements (managing temperature distribution inside a room), the new AVS can also leverage user engagement and behavior change for energy efficiency in buildings by facilitating a new practice for occupants' interaction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.", "year": 2020}
